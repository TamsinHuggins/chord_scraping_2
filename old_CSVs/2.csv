 [Verse 1]
            When you try your best, but you don't succeed
            When you get what you want, but not what you need
            When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
                 Stuck in re - ver - se.
  
 [Verse 2]
            When the tears come streaming down your face
            When you lose something you can't replace
            When you love someone, but it goes to waste
               Could it be  wo - rse?

 [Verse 1]
   Everybody loves the things you do
                   From the way you talk to the way you move
   Everybody here is watching  you
                      Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come  true
  
   But if by chance you're here alone
               Can I have a moment before I go
   Cause I've been by myself all night long
                Hoping you're someone  I used to know
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
                   You look like a movie
                   You sound like a song
                My God this reminds me
                  Of when we were young
  
 [Chorus]
         Let me photograph you in this light, in case it is the last time
          That we might be exactly like we were before we realized
           We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
                     It was just like a movie,   it was just like a song
  
 [Verse 2]
    I was so scared to face my fears
             And nobody told me that you'd be here
   And I swear you'd moved overseas
                 That's what you  said when you left me
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
                         You still look like a movie

       When we were young
       When we were young
       When we were young
       When we were young
  
       It's hard to admit that, everything just takes me back
          To when you were there
          To when you were there
        And a part of me keeps holding on, just in case it hasn't gone
          I guess I still care
     Do you still care?

0,Take Me Home Country Roads chords,Take Me Home Country Roads – John Denver,"[Verse 1]
  
  Almost Heaven; West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
  Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains,
    Blowin' like a breeze.
  
 [Chorus]
  
           Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
           West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
  
 [Verse 2]
  
  All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
  Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine,
    Teardrop in my eye.
  
 [Chorus]
  
           Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
           West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
  
 [Bridge]
  
    I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me,
      The radio reminds me of my home far away.
      And driving down the road I get a feeling
         That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.
  
 [Chorus]
  
 N.C.      Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
           West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
           Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
           West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
           Take me home, down country roads; take me home, down country roads

   I met you in the dark
   You lit me up
   You made me feel as though
   I was enough
  
   We danced the night away
   We drank too much
   I held your hair back when
   You were throwing up
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
   Then you smiled over your shoulder
   For a minute, I was stone cold sober
   I pulled you closer to my chest
  
   And you asked me to stay over
   I said, I already told ya
   I think that you should get some rest

   Cause I played it cool when I was 
 Scared of letting go

   But I never showed
   But I wanna stay with you

   I wake you up with some
   Breakfast in bed
   I'll bring you coffee with 
   a kiss on your head
  
   And I'll take the kids to school
   Wave them goodbye
   And I'll thank my lucky stars 
   for that night

   For a minute, I forget that I'm older
   I wanna dance with you right now, oh
  
 And you look as beautiful as ever
   And I swear that everyday you'll get better
   You make me feel this way somehow

   Darling your love is more than
   Worth its weight in gold

 [Verse]
 Step one you say we need to talk
      He walks you say sit down it’s just a talk
               He smiles politely back at you
               You stare politely right on through
                 Some sort of window to your right
               As he goes left and you stay right
                Between the lines of fear and blame
                     And you begin to wonder why you came

 And pray to God he hears you
      And pray to God he hears you

    He will do one of two things
 He will admit to everything
 Or he’ll say he’s just not the same

 And the violence caused such silence, who are we mistaken

             With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns

 [Verse 1]
  
    A long, long time ago
 I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
      And I knew if I had my chance
       That I could make those people dance and maybe they'd be happy for a while
      But February made me shiver, with every paper I'd deliver
 Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step
    I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride
 Something touched me deep inside
      The day the music died
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
     So bye, bye Miss American Pie
           Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
           And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
          Singin' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Did you write the book of love
         And do you have faith in God above, if the bible tells you so?
 Do you believe in rock and roll
      Can music save your mortal soul and can you teach me how to dance real slow?
         Well I know that you're in love with him 'cuz I saw you dancin' in the gym
      You both kicked off your shoes, man I dig those rhythm and blues
          I was a lonely teenage bronckin' buck with a pink carnation and a pickup truck
      But I knew I was out of luck the day the music died,  I started singin'
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Bye, bye Miss American Pie

          Singin' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
           Now for ten years we've been on our own
        and moss grows fat on a rolling stone but that's not how it used to be
            When the jester sang for the king and queen
       in a coat he borrowed from James Dean in a voice that came from you and me
           Oh, and while the king was looking down, the jester stole his thorny crown
       The courtroom was adjourned, no verdict was returned
            And while Lennin read a book on Marx, the quartet practiced in the park
      And we sang dirges in the dark the day the music died,   we were singin'
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Bye, bye Miss American Pie
           Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry

          Singin' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
 Helter skelter in a summer swelter
 the birds flew off with a fallout shelter, eight miles high and fallin' fast
        It landed foul on the grass
        the players tried for a forward pass, with the jester on the sidelines in a cast
           Now the half-time air was sweet perfume, while sergeants played a marching tune
 We all got up to dance, but we never got the chance
           'Cuz the players tried to take the field, the marching band refused to yield
 Do you recall what was revealed the day the music died,   we started singin'
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Bye, bye Miss American Pie
           Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry

          Singin' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die
  
  
 [Verse 5]
  
       And there we were all in one place
      a generation lost in space, with no time left to start again
              So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack Flash sat on a candle
         stick, 'cuz fire is the devil's only friend
       And as I watched him on the stage, my hands were clenched in fists of rage
     No angel born in Hell could break that Satan's spell
             And as the flames climbed high into the night to light the sacrificial rite
        I saw Satan laughing with delight the day the music died,   he was singin'

 [Verse 6]
  
    I met a girl who sang the blues
        And I asked her for some happy news, but she just smiled and turned away
    I went down to the sacred store
         Where I'd heard the music years before, but the man there said the music
           wouldn't play
      But in the streets the children screamed, the lovers cried and the poets dreamed
      But not a word was spoken, the church bells all were broken
          And the three men I admire most, the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
 They caught the last train for the coast the day the music died,
 N.C.
 And they were singin'

             And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.
  
 [Chorus]
          So I'm not moving...
          I'm not moving.
  
 [Verse]
 Policeman says, son you can't stay here,
                   I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year,
 Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows,
      If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go.
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
             'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me,
             And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be,
           Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet,
             And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.
  
 [Chorus]
          So I'm not moving...
          I'm not moving.
          So I'm not moving...
          I'm not moving.
          So I'm not moving...
          I'm not moving.
  
 [Interlude]
 People talk about the guy
         Who's waiting on a girl...
  
 Oohoohwoo
 There are no holes in his shoes
            But a big hole in his world...
  
 Hmmmm
  
 [Bridge]
 Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved,
          And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news,
 And you'll come running to the corner...
 'Cause you'll know it's just for you
  
 I'm the man who can't be moved
            I'm the man who can't be moved...
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
             'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me,

          So I'm not moving...

 [Outro]
        Going back to the corner where I first saw you,
         Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, no I'm not gonna move.

   Right from the start
               You were a thief, you stole my heart
      And I your willing victim
    I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
           And with every touch you fixed them
  
  
 [Pre-chorus 1]
      Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh oh
 Things you never say to me, oh oh
 Tell me that you've had enough
 Of our love, our love
  
  
 [Chorus]
 Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
         Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
             And we can learn to love again
                               It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts

            Well I've heard there was a secret chord,
       That David played and it pleased the Lord,
      But you don't really care for music, do ya?
     It goes like this, the 4th, the 5th,
      The minor fall and the major lift,
      The baffled king composing hallelujah,
       Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu------jah
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
 [Verse 2]
            Your faith was strong but you needed proof,
       You saw her bathing on the roof,
      Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya,
     She tied yo to her kitchen chair,
     She broke your throne and she cut your hair,
     And from your lips she drew the hallelujah,
       Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu------jah
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
 [Verse 3]
         Well baby I've been here before,
      I know this room and I've walked this floor,
      I used to live alone before I knew ya.
         And I've seen your flag on the marble arch,
      And love is not a victory march,
        It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah,
       Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu------jah
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
 [Verse 4]
         There was a time when you let me know,
        What's really going on below,
      But now you never show it to me do ya.
        Well remember when I moved in you,
         And the holy dove was moving too,
      And every breath we drew was hallelujah,
       Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu------jah
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
 [Verse 5]
 Maybe there is a God above,
       But all I ever learned from love,
      Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew ya.
       And it's not a cry you can hear at night,
        It's not somebody who's seen the light,
        It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah,
       Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-jah
       Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu------jah

 [Verse 1]
 Twenty-five years and my life is still
 Trying to get up that great big hill
     Of hope for a destination
 I realized quickly when I knew I should
           That the world was made up of this brotherhood
     Of man, for whatever that means
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
           And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
          Just to get it all out, what's in my head
        and I - I am feeling a little peculiar
           And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
        and I take a deep breath and I get real high and
    I scream at the top of my lungs ""What's going on?""
  
 [Chorus]
              And I said ""Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey""
          I said ""Hey, what's going on?""

                      I pray every single day
            For a revolution

 [Verse 1]
  
   Now and then I think of when we were together
   Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
   Told myself that you were right for me
   But felt so lonely in your company
   But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

 [Verse 2]
  
 You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
   Like resignation to the end
 Always the end
   So when we found that we could not make sense
   Well you said that we would still be friends
   But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   But you didn't have to cut me off
   Make out like it never happened
           And that we were nothing
      And I don't even need your love
          But you treat me like a stranger
           And that feels so rough
   You didn't have to stoop so low
   Have your friends collect your records
           And then change your number
    I guess that I don't need that though
 Now you're just somebody that I used to know
  
  
 Now you're just somebody that I used to know
  
  
 Now you're just somebody that I used to know
  
  
 [Interlude]
  
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
   Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
   But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
   And I don't wanna live that way
   Reading into every word you say
   You said that you could let it go
        And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   But you didn't have to cut me off

              I want this world in my hands
              I hate the beach
         But I stand in California
                       with my toes in the sand
                            Use the sleeves on my sweater
                  Let's have an adventure
                Head in the clouds, my gravity's centered
            Touch my neck, yeah, and I'll touch yours

           And if I may just take your breath away
 I don't mind if there's not much to say
   The silence guides our minds
      to move to a place so far away
  The goosebumps start to raise
   When my left hand meets your waist, yeah
  
 then I watch your face
   Oh-oh, I watch your face, yeah
  
 These hearts adore
 All the other beats hardest for
   Inside this place is warm
   Outside it starts to pour

 [Verse 1]
      Old pirates, yes, they rob I.
       Sold I to the merchant ships
   minutes after they took I   from the bottomless pit.
         But my hand was made strong
   By the hand of the Almighty.
     We forward in this generation triumphantly.

 The club isn't the best place to find a lover so the bar is where I go
 Me and my friends at the table doing shots, drinking fast and then we talk slow
       Come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I'll give it a chance now
          Take my hand, stop! Put Van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance and now I'm singing like

 Your love was handmade for somebody like me

 Grab on my waist and put that body on me

              I'm in love with your body
   And last night you were in my room
                 And now my bedsheets smell like you

 One week in we let the story begin
              We're going out on our first date
              But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
               Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
              We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
               And how your family is doin' okay
                And leave and get in a taxi, we kiss in the backseat

 [Intro]
                  Hey!
                  Hey!
                  Hey!
  
 [Verse 1]
 I don't like walking around this old and empty house
     So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
      The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
           It's the house telling you to close your eyes
      And some days I can't even dress myself
       It's killing me to see you this way
  
 [Chorus]
                    'Cause though the truth may vary, this
   ship will carry our
 bodies safe to shore
  
 [Interlude]
                  Hey!
                  Hey!
                  Hey!
  
 [Verse 2]
             There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
        Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
 Soon it will be over and buried with our past
     We used to play outside when we were young (and full of life and full of love)
 Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
       Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear
  
 [Chorus]
                    'Cause though the truth may vary, this
   ship will carry our
 bodies safe to shore   Hey!
        Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
      The screams all sound the same. Hey!
             Though the truth may vary, this
   ship will carry our
 bodies safe to shore
  
 [Instrumental]
                  Hey!
                  Hey!
  
 [Verse 3]
         You're gone, gone, gone away. I watched you disappear
 All that's left is a ghost of you
            Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
       Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
      Now wait, wait, wait for me. Please hang around
       I'll see you when I fall asleep. Hey!
  
 [Chorus]
        Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
      The screams all sound the same. Hey!
             Though the truth may vary, this
   ship will carry our
 bodies safe to shore
  
        Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
 It's a little bit funny,   this feeling inside
 I'm not one of those who can easily hide
 I don't have much money, but boy, if I did
 I'd buy a big house where we both could live
  
 If I was a sculptor,   but then again, no
       Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
     I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
 My gift is my song, and this one's for you
  
  
 [Chorus]
 And you can tell everybody this is your song
 It may be quite simple but now that it's done
 I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
 That I put down in words,
        How wonderful life is while you're in the world
  
  
 [Interlude]
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 I sat on the roof     and kicked off the moss
          Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
 But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
 It's for people like you that keep it turned on
  
 So excuse me forgetting,   but these things I do
 You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
 Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
 Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
  
  
 [Chorus]
 And you can tell everybody this is your song
 It may be quite simple but now that it's done
 I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
 That I put down in words,
        How wonderful life is while you're in the world

            When the days are cold
           And the cards all fold
           And the saints we see
           Are all made of gold
             When your dreams all fail
           And the ones we hail
           Are the worst of all
           And the blood’s run stale
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  I want to hide the truth
  I want to shelter you
  But with the beast inside
  There’s nowhere we can hide
  No matter what we breed
  We still are made of greed
  This is my kingdom come
  This is my kingdom come
  
 [Chorus]
  When you feel my heat
  Look into my eyes
  It’s where my demons hide
  It’s where my demons hide
  Don’t get too close
  It’s dark inside
  It’s where my demons hide
  It’s where my demons hide
  
 [Verse 2]
            When the curtain’s call
          Is the last of all
            When the lights fade out
           All the sinners crawl
           So they dug your grave
           And the masquerade
             Will come calling out
          At the mess you made
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 Don’t wanna let you down
  But I am hellbound
  Though this is all for you
  Don’t wanna hide the truth
   No matter what we breed
  We still are made of greed
  This is my kingdom come
  This is my kingdom come
  
 [Chorus]
  When you feel my heat
  Look into my eyes
  It’s where my demons hide
  It’s where my demons hide
  Don’t get too close
  It’s dark inside
  It’s where my demons hide
  It’s where my demons hide
  
 [Verse 3]
   They say it's what you make
 I say it's up to fate
  It's woven in my soul
  I need to let you go
  Your eyes, they shine so bright
  I want to save that light
  I can't escape this now
  
  Unless you show me how
  
 [Chorus]
  When you feel my heat
  Look into my eyes
  It’s where my demons hide
  It’s where my demons hide
  Don’t get too close
  It’s dark inside
  It’s where my demons hide
  It’s where my demons hide

 [Verse 1]
               When the night has come
   And the land is dark
              And the moon is the only light we'll see
            No, I won't be afraid,
        No, I won't be afraid
              Just as long as you stand, stand by me.

      Oh, stand by me.
      Oh, stand, stand by me,
 Stand by me.
  
 [Verse 2]
           If the sky that we look upon
 Should tumble and fall
              Or the mountain should crumble to the sea,
            I won't cry, I won't cry,
        No, I won't shed a tear
              Just as long as you stand, stand by me.
  
 [Chorus]
                        And darling, darling, stand by me,
      Oh, stand by me.
       Oh, stand now, stand by me,
 Stand by me.

      The best thing about tonight’s that we’re not fighting
              It couldn’t be that we have been this way before
    I know you don’t think that I am trying
    I know you’re wearing thin down to the core
  
 [Chorus]
      But hold your breath
            Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
         Over again
                         Don’t make me change my mind
  
          I won’t live to see another day
    I swear it’s true
            Because a girl like you is impossible to find
                        You’re impossible to find

  This is not what I intended
             I always swore to you that I would never fall apart
    You always thought that I was stronger
               I may have failed
                                    But I have loved you from the start

 It's impossible

    Breathe me in
      I’m yours to keep

 When you’re asleep

             Or I won’t live to see another day
