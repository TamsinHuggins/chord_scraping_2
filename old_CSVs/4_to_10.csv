 [Verse 1]
 I was left to my own de-v-i-c-e-s
   Many days fell away with nothing to show
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
           And the walls kept tumbling down
                     In the city that we l-o-v-e-d
          Great clouds roll over the hills

 N.C.                    But if you close your eyes,
           Does it almost feel like
   Nothing changed at all?
                         And if you close your eyes,
           Does it almost feel like
   You've been here before?
       How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
       How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
 In your pose as the dust settles around us

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
 Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
 Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore
        And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
            For me it happens all the time
  
 [Chorus]
         It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
 Said I wouldn't come, but I lost all control and I need you now
         And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now
  
 [Verse 2]
   Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door
 Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
        And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
            For me it happens all the time
  
 [Chorus]
         It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
 Said I wouldn't come, but I lost all control and I need you now
         And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

 [Verse]
 Please don't see
 Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
 Please see me
 Reaching out for someone I can't see
 Take my hand, let's see where we wake up tomorrow
              Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
           I'll be damned, cupid's demanding back his arrow
 So let's get drunk on our tears and

 Who are we?
 Just a speck of dust within the galaxy
 Woe is me
 If we're not careful, turns into reality
 Don't you dare, let our best memories bring you sorrow

 Where we're dancing on our tears

 [Verse 1]
 Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world
 She took the midnight train going anywhere
 Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit
 He took the midnight train going anywhere
  
 A singer in a smoky room, a smell of wine and cheap perfume
 For a smile they can share the night, it goes on and on and on and on
  
 [Chorus]
 Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
   Their shadows searching in the night
 Streetlight, people, living just to find emotion
 Hiding, somewhere in the night
  
 [Verse 2]
 Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill
         Paying anything to roll the dice, just one more time
 Some will win, some will lose, some were born to sing the blues
   Oh, the movie never ends; it goes on and on and on and on
  
 [Chorus]
 Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
   Their shadows searching in the night
 Streetlight, people, living just to find emotion
 Hiding, somewhere in the night

 Don't stop believing hold on to the feeling
 Streetlight people
 Don't stop believing hold on to the feeling
 Streetlight people

 Today I don't feel like doing anything
 I just wanna lay in my bed
 Don't feel like picking up my phone
 So leave a message at the tone
 Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

      Uh, I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
 Turn the TV on, Throw my hand in my pants
 Nobody's gonna tell me I can't, nah

 Click to MTV so they can teach me how to dougie

               Don't let me down, I pray
             Oh, pretty baby,

                And let me love you, baby
          Let me love you
  
 [Verse 1]
                  You're just too good to be true
                Can't take my eyes off you
                You'd be like heaven to touch
          I wanna hold you so much
                At long last love has arrived
              And I thank God I'm alive
                  You're just too good to be true

 [Verse 1]
            When you try your best but you don't succeed,
            When you get what you want, but not what you need,
            When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep,
             Stuck in reverse.
  
 [Verse 2]
            And the tears come streaming down your face,
            When you lose something you can't replace,
            When you love someone but it goes to waste,
               Could it be worse?

 And ignite your bones,
 And I will try to fix you,

               When you're too in love to let it go,

                    Just what you're worth.

 [Verse]
 Walking down 29th and Park
 I saw you in another’s arms
 Only a month we’ve been apart
            You look happier
 Saw you walk inside a bar
 He said something to make you laugh
 I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
                 Yeah, you look happier, you do
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 Ain’t nobody hurt you like I hurt you
       But ain’t nobody love you like I do
 Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
 If you’re moving on with someone new
  
 [Chorus]
                       Cause baby you look happier, you do
                      My friends told me one day I’d feel it too
                      And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
                    But I know I was happier with you
  
 [Verse]
 Sat in the corner of the room
 Everything’s reminding me of you
 Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you’re happier
 Aren’t you?
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 Ain’t nobody hurt you like I hurt you
       But ain’t nobody need you like I do
 I know that there’s others that deserve you
          But my darling, I am still in love with you
  
 [Chorus]
                       But I guess you look happier, you do

 *************************************************************************************
 This song is from the upcoming release, ""Plans"" which is coming August 30th. I have a
 copy already and thought I would do those looking for the chords when it's released a
 service. It's a great, sparse little folk song that emphasizes the bottom half of the
 chords and strums mostly on the upbeats. The way this is done is by picking the bottom
 two notes of the chord on the downbeats of the verses.
  
 For example, with the F chord, it's played something like this, but the upper half of
 the chord is strummed more than once in the rise and fall of the strumming hand:
  
 e   1      1
 B   1      1
 G   2      2
 D   3      3
 A   3      3
  
 The chorus is pretty much exactly like the introduction.

         On the first part of the journey
        I was looking at all the life
             There were plants and birds and rocks and things
             There were sand and hills and rings
      The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
          And the sky with no clouds
      The heat was hot and the ground was dry
          But the air was full of sound

             There were sand and hills and rings
      The ocean is a desert with its life underground

           Down those country  lanes singing to Tiny Dancer
          And I miss the  way you make  me feel      and it's real
           When we watched the  sunset over the castle on the hill
  
  
 [Verse 2]
   Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
   Running from the law through the backfields and  getting drunk with my friends
   Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon I did it
 Right, I was younger  then,  take me back to when we found
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus 2]
   Weekend jobs and when we got paid
                      We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
                 Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
   But I can't wait to go home
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
      I'm on my   way, driving at ninety
           Down those country  lanes singing to Tiny Dancer
          And I miss the  way you make  me feel      and it's real
      We watched the  sunset over the castle on the hill
                  Over the castle on the hill
                  Over the castle on the hill
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
    One friend left to sell clothes, one works down by the coast
    One had two kids but lives alone, one's brother overdosed
    One's already on his second wife, one's just barely getting by but
 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""Bm"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Bm</span>    These people raised me and I-I-I, can't wait to go home
  
  
 [Chorus 3]
          And I'm on my   way, I still remember
            These old country  lanes when we did not know the answers
          And I miss the  way you make  me feel      and it's real
      We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
                  Over the castle on the hill
                  Over the castle on the hill

 I came home
           Like a stone
               And I fell heavy into your arms
            These days of dust
             Which we've known
            Will blow away with this new sun

        And relent

               And him with less

   Now I'll be bold

          Use my head alongside my heart
             So take my flesh
             And fix my eyes
                That tethered mind free from the lies

 [Intro]
 |  
 [Verse 1]
  I'm so glad you made the time to see me
  How's life, tell me how's your family
  I haven't seen them in a while
  You've been good, busier than ever
  We small talk, work and the weather
  Your guard is up, and I know why
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  Because the last time you saw me
              Is still burned in the back of your mind
                 You gave me roses and I left them there to die
  
 [Chorus]
       So this is me swallowing my pride
               Standing in front of you saying
                       ""I'm sorry for that night"" and I go
   Back to December all the time
      It turns out freedom ain't
   Nothing but missing you
 Wishing I'd realized what I had
        When you were mine
  
 [Post-Chorus]
          I'd go back to December,
   Turn around and make it all right
       I go back to December all the time
  
 [Instrumental]
 |  
 [Verse 2]
  These days I haven't been sleeping
  Stayin' up playing back myself leaving
  When your birthday passed and I didn't call
            Then I think about summer all the beautiful times
  I watch you laughing from the passenger side
       And realized I loved you in the fall
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  And then the cold came the dark days
          When fear crept into my mind
                You gave me all your love and
           All I gave you was goodbye
  
 [Chorus]
       So this is me swallowing my pride
               Standing in front of you saying
                       ""I'm sorry for that night"" and I go
   Back to December all the time
     It turns out freedom ain't
   Nothing but missing you
 Wishing I'd realized what I had
        When you were mine
  
 [Post-Chorus]
          I'd go back to December,
   Turn around and change my own mind
       I go back to December all the time
  
 [Solo]

 [Bridge]
               I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
      So good to me, so right
               And how you held me in your arms
                  That September night
                      The first time you ever saw me cry
                                Maybe this is wishful thinking
                            Probably mindless dreaming
   If you loved again I swear I'd love you right
  
         I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
             So if the chain is on your door I understand
  
 [Interlude]
      But this is me swallowing my pride
              Standing in front of you saying
                      ""I'm sorry for that night"" and I go
 Back to December...

      It turns out freedom ain't

 Wishing I'd realized what I had
        When you were mine
          I'd go back to December
   Turn around and make it all right

 [Verse 1]
 Going out tonight, changes into something red
   Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
 Everything she never had
                   She’s showing off
 Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
   She's heading for something that she won’t forget
   Having no regrets is all that she really wants
  
 [Chorus]
   We're only getting older baby
   And I've been thinking about it lately
   Does it ever drive you crazy
 Just how fast the night changes
   Everything that you've ever dreamed of
   Disappearing when you wake up
   But there’s nothing to be afraid of
 Even when the night changes
   It will never change me and you
  
 [Verse 2]
 Chasing her tonight, doubts are running ‘round her head
   He’s waiting, hides behind his cigarette
 Heart is beating loud, she doesn't want it to stop
 Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
   She’s falling, doesn't even know it yet
 Having no regrets is all that she really wants
  
 [Chorus]
   We're only getting older baby
   And I've been thinking about it lately
   Does it ever drive you crazy
 Just how fast the night changes
   Everything that you've ever dreamed of
   Disappearing when you wake up
   But there’s nothing to be afraid of
 Even when the night changes
   It will never change me and you
  
 [Breakdown]
  
 [Bridge]
   Going out tonight, changes into something red
   Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
    Reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lost
  
 [Final Chorus]
   We're only getting older baby
   And I've been thinking about it lately
   Does it ever drive you crazy
 Just how fast the night changes
   Everything that you've ever dreamed of
   Disappearing when you wake up
    But there’s nothing to be afraid of
 Even when the night changes
   Everything that you've ever dreamed of
   Disappearing when you wake up
 But there’s nothing to be afraid of
 Even when the night changes
  
 [Outro]
   It will never change, baby
   We will never change, baby
   It will never change me and you

   Next year all our troubles will be miles away
  
  
 [Bridge]
       Once again as in olden days
        Happy golden days      of yore
 Faithful friends who were dear to us
          Will be near to us    once more
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 Someday soon we all will be together
   If the Fates allow
   Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow
     So have yourself a merry little Christmas now.

 [Verse 1]
 I threw a wish in the well,
 Don't ask me, I'll never tell
 I looked to you as it fell,
 and now you're in my way
 I trade my soul for a wish,
 pennies and dimes for a kiss
 I wasn't looking for this,
 but now you're in my way
 Your stare was holdin', ripped jeans, skin was showin'
 Hot night, wind was blowin'
 Where you think you're going, baby?
  
  
 [Chorus]
 Hey, I just met you,
 and this is crazy,
 but here's my number,
 so call me, maybe?
 It's hard to look right,
 at you baaaabeh,
 but here's my number,
 so call me, maybe?
  
 Hey, I just met you,
 and this is crazy,
 but here's my number,
 so call me, maybe?
 And all the other boys,
 try to chase me,
 but here's my number,

 [Verse 2]
 You took your time with the call,
 I took no time with the fall
 You gave me nothing at all,
 but still, you're in my way
 I beg and borrow and steal
 At first sight and it's real
 I didn't know I would feel it,
 but it's in my way
 Your stare was holdin', ripped jeans, skin was showin'
 Hot night, wind was blowin'
 Where you think you're going, baby?

         All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
      I'm standing here outside your door
    I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
          But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn,
      The taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn
    Already I'm so lonesome I could die

     So kiss me and smile for me
 Tell me that you'll wait for me
 Hold me like you'll never let me go

   Oh babe, I hate to go
  
 [Verse 2]
             There's so many times I've let you down
     So many times I've played around
    I tell you now they don't mean a thing
        Every place I go I'll think of you
        Every song I sing I'll sing for you
       When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring

 Now the time has come to leave you
 One more time let me kiss you
       Then close your eyes I'll be on my way
 Dream about the days to come
       When I won't have to leave alone
   About the times I won't have to say

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
 We both lie silently still, in the dead of the night.
               Although we both lie close together, we feel miles apart inside.
            Was it something I said, or something I did,
           did my words not come out right?
            Though I tried not to hurt you, though I tried, but I guess that's why they say
  
 [Chorus]
 Every rose has its thorn.
             Just like every night has its dawn.
             Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song.
   Every rose has its thorn.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Verse 2]
    I listen to our favorite song, playing on the radio.
            Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and   easy go.
         But I wonder, does he know, has he ever felt like this?
         And I know that you'd be here right now if I
   coulda let you know, somehow I guess
  
 [Chorus]
 Every rose has its thorn.
             Just like every night has its dawn.
             Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song.
   Every rose has its thorn.
  
 [Bridge]
   Though it's been a while now, I can still feel so much pain.
  Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals, but the scar, that scar remains

     I know I coulda saved our love that night if I'd     known what to say.
   Instead of making love we both  made our separate ways.
       And now I hear you've found somebody new, and that I never meant that much to you.
      To hear that tears me up inside, and to see you cuts me like a knife, I guess
  
 [Chorus]
 Every rose has its thorn.
             Just like every night has its dawn.

 I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
    Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
 I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
 Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
            And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

 [Verse 1]
  
                        I thought I saw a man brought to life
                                                                   He was warm, he came around like he was dignified
  
             He showed me what it was to cry
                        Well you couldn't be that man I adored
  
             You don't seem to know
                                                       Don't seem to care what your heart is for

                                            There's nothing where he used to lie
                                   My conversation has run dry
                                  That's what's going on
                                  Nothing's fine

 This a Fantastic Song.  I have listenend to this track repeatedly and I
 feel that this is pretty close, I have limited knowledge of Chords, so
 the Build-Up is no doubt using Chords, If so, please contact me and tell

 Gotta gotta be down
  
 Because I want it all

 It was only a kiss

       Well you done done me in, you bet I felt it
     I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted,
    I fell right through the cracks,
 And now I'm tryin' to get back...
              Before the cool done run out, I'll be givin' it my bestest
        And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
      I reckon it's again my turn,
      To win some or learn some...
  
  
 [Chorus 1]

 Well open up your mind and see like me

                                       look into your heart and you'll find love love love
 Listen to the music of the moment come and sing/dance with me
                      We're just one big family
                                         And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved

              There's no need to complicate
                Our time is short
               This is our fate, I'm yours
  
  
 [Adlib]
  
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
       I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
     And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
    But my breath fogged up the glass,
 And so I drew a new face and I laughed
              I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
        To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
      It's what we aim to do
      Our name is our virtue
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
  
 But I won't hesitate
              No more, no more
              It cannot wait, I'm yours
  
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
 Well, open up your mind and see like me
                                       Open up your plans and damn you're free
                                       Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours
  
  
 [Outro]
  
 So please don't—please—don't—please don't—
              There's no need to complicate
                'Cause our time is short
               This o—this o—this is our fate, I'm yours

           Now I've heard there was a secret chord
       That David played, and it pleased the Lord
      But you don't really care for music, do you?
     It goes like this the fourth, the fifth
      The minor fall, the major lift
      The baffled king composing Hallelujah
       Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-u-jah
  
 [Verse 2]
       Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
      You saw her bathing on the roof
      Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
      She tied you to a kitchen chair
      She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
      And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
       Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-u-jah

      You say I took the name in vain
 I don't even know the name
      But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
            There's a blaze of light in every word
     It doesn't matter which you heard
      The holy or the broken Hallelujah

    I did my best, it wasn't much
    I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
       I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
      And even though it all went wrong
       I'll stand before the Lord of Song

     Em7[022033]      add that low E string for the D/F#.

 Fifteen  flares inside those ocean eyes

 [Verse 1]
 I will leave my heart at the door
          I won't say a word
          They've all been said before, you know
  
     So why don't we just play pretend
                 Like we're not scared of what is coming next
     Or scared of having nothing left

 If this is my last night with you
 Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
            Give me a memory I  can use
 Take me by the hand

       Your honesty

           tell me, who do I run to?

 [Verse 1]
   When the rain is blowing in your face
   And the whole world is on your case
   I could offer you a warm embrace
   To make you feel my love
  
 [Verse 2]
   When evening shadows and the stars appear
   And there is no one there to dry your tears
   I could hold you for a million years
   To make you feel my love
  
 [Chorus 1]
 I know you haven't made your mind up yet
 But I would never do you wrong
 I've known it from the moment that we met
 No doubt in my mind where you belong
  
 [Verse 3]
   I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
   I'd go crawling down the avenue
   No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
   To make you feel my love

 I remember when we broke up the first time 
 saying this is it I've had enough cause like 
     we haven't seen each other in a month 
           when you said you needed space what?
  
 Then you come around again and say
         baby I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
           Trust me remember how that lasted for a day
          I say I hate you we break up you call me I love you
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 Ooh      we called it off again last night 
      but ooh     this time I'm telling you I'm telling you

 We are never ever ever getting back together
 We are never ever ever getting back together 
 You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me 
      but we are never ever ever ever getting back together
        like ever  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
      I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
         and me falling for it screaming that I'm right
                And you would hide away and find your peace of mind 
            with some indie record that's much cooler than mine
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 Ooh     you called me up again tonight 
      But ooh     this time I'm telling you I'm telling you

 this is exhausting you know like, we are never getting back together like ever

 I can almost see it
  
 That dream I’m dreaming but
 There’s a voice inside my head sayin’,
 You’ll never reach it,
 Every step I’m taking,
  
 Every move I make feels
 Lost with no direction
 My faith is shaking but

        Gotta keep my head held high

 There’s always gonna be another mountain
  
 I’m always gonna wanna make it move
 Always gonna be an uphill battle,
 Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose,
 Ain’t about how fast I get there,

 The struggles I’m facing,
  
 The chances I’m taking
 Sometimes might knock me down but
 No, I’m not breaking

 But these are the moments that
 I’m gonna remember most, yeah
 Just gotta keep going

   Well life will pass me by if I don’t open up my eyes
   Well that’s fine by me
  
 [Chorus]
             So wake me up when it’s all over
 When I’m wiser and I’m older
 All this time I was finding myself
       And I   didn’t know I was lost
     So wake me up when it’s all over
 When I’m wiser and I’m older
 All this time I was finding myself
       And I   didn’t know I was lost
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
  
 [Verse 2]
   I tried carrying the weight of the world
   But I only have two hands
   Hope I get the chance to travel the world
   And I don’t have any plans
   Wish that I could stay forever this young
   Not afraid to close my eyes
   Life’s a game made for everyone
   And love is a prize
  
 [Chorus]
             So wake me up when it’s all over
 When I’m wiser and I’m older
 All this time I was finding myself
       And I   didn’t know I was lost
             So wake me up when it’s all over
 When I’m wiser and I’m older
 All this time I was finding myself
       And I   didn’t know I was lost
  
 [Bridge]
   I didn’t know I was lost
   I didn’t know I was lost
   I didn’t know I was lost
   I didn’t know I was lost

 Ku tuliskan kenangan tentang
         Caraku menemukan dirimu
 tentang apa yang membuatku mudah
      Berikan hatiku padamu
  
 Takkan habis sejuta lagu
           Untuk menceritakan cantikmu
 Kan teramat panjang puisi
        Tuk menyuratkan cinta ini
  
 [Chorus]
                Telah habis sudah cinta ini
                Tak lagi tersisa untuk dunia
                    Karena telah ku habiskan
          Sisa cintaku hanya untukmu
  
 Aku pernah berfikir tentang
          Hidupku tanpa ada dirimu
 Dapatkah lebih indah dari
          Yang ku jalani sampai kini
  
 Aku slalu bermimpi tentang
          Indah hari tua bersamamu
 Tetap cantik rambut panjangmu
           Meskipun nanti tak hitam lagi
  
 [Chorus]
               Bila habis sudah waktu ini
                 Tak lagi berpijak pada dunia
              Telah aku habiskan
         Sisa hidupku hanya untukmu
  
                   Dan tlah habis sudah cinta ini
                Tak lagi tersisa untuk dunia
                    Karena telah ku habiskan
          Sisa cintaku hanya untukmu
       Untukmu
            Hidup dan matiku

 White lips, pale face

                Burnt lungs, sour taste
 Light's gone, day's end
                Struggling to pay rent

 [Verse 1]
              I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
              I threw the day old tea from the cup
    Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
      Memories of a life that’s been loved
  
              Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
             Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
    Dad always told me don’t you cry when you’re down
                    But mum there’s a tear every time that I blink
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus 1]
    Oh I’m in pieces, it’s tearing me up but I know
    A heart that’s broke is a heart that’s been loved
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
               So I’ll sing Hallelujah 
              You were an angel in the shape of my mum
              When I fell down you’d be there
 Holding me up, spread your wings as you go 
            And when God takes you back, he’ll say Hallelujah, you’re home
  
  
 [Verse 2]
                   I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
              Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
      John said he’d drive then put his hand on my cheek
              And wiped a tear from the side of my face
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus 2]
    And I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know
    A life with love is a life that’s been lived
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
               So I’ll sing Hallelujah 
              You were an angel in the shape of my mum

 [Verse 1] (play intro)
 So lately you're wondering who will be there to take my place
 When I'm gone you'll need love to light the shadows on your face
 If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
 Then between sand and stone could you make it on your own?

 And maybe I'll find out a way to make it back someday
 To watch you to guide you through the darkest of your days

 Well, then I hope there's someone out there who can bring me back to you

    Looks like we made it, Look how far we've come my baby
    We mighta took the long way, We knew we'd get there someday
    They said, ""I bet they'll never make it""
           But just look at us holding on

 [Verse 1]
  I was down at the New Amsterdam  staring at this yellow-haired girl
      Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation with this black-haired flamenco dancer
           You know she dances while his father plays guitar.  She's suddenly beautiful
     We all want something beautiful,  man, I wish I was beautiful
  
          So come dance this silence down through the morning
            Sha la la la la la la la la yeah       uh huh  yeah
  Cut up, Maria!  Show me some of them Spanish dances
      And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
   Believe in me.  Help me believe in anything
         'Cause I want to be someone who believes, yeah
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
  Mr. Jones and me, tell each other fairy tales
      and we stare at the beautiful women
         ""She's looking at you.  Ah, no, no, she's looking at me.""
                 Smiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo
       When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely
  
 [Verse 2]
  
        Well, I will paint my picture.  Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
  All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful (yeah, well you know)
 Gray is my favorite color  I-I felt so symbolic yesterday
  If I knew Picasso I would buy myself a gray guitar and play
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
  
  Mr. Jones and me, look into the future
          yeah we stare at the beautiful women
         ""She's looking at you.  Uh, I don't think so.  She's looking at me.""
 Standing in the spotlight, I bought myself a gray guitar
       When everybody lo-ves me,  I will never be lo-one-ly
  
 [Bridge]
                  I will never be lonely
            I'm never gonna be looone-ly
 I want to be a lion.  Everybody wants to pass as cats
 We all want to be big, big stars, yeah but we got different reasons for that.
  Believe in me because I don't believe in anything
      And I want to be someone to believe, to believe, to believe.
  
  
 [Chorus 3]
  
  Mr. Jones and me, stumbling through the barrio
          Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
         ""She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me.""
 I want to be Bob Dylan
      Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
      When everybody loves you, ah son, that's just about as funky as you can be.
  
  Mr. Jones and me, staring at the video
         When I look at the television, I want to see me staring right back at me.
 We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why, and we don't know how.
           But when everybody loves me, I'm going to be just about as happy as I can be.
  
 Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars.....

 [Verse 3]
   And in my dreams, I meet the ghosts of all the people who've come and gone
   Memories, they seem to show up so quick but they leave you far too soon
      Naive, I was just staring at the barrel of the gun
              And I do believe that
  
 [Chorus 2]
 But I've got
  high hopes, it takes me back to when we started
  High hopes, when you   let it go, go out and start again
  High hopes,  oh when it all comes to an end
                       And the world keeps spinning 
   yeah the world keeps spinning around

 Sometimes I feel like
 I don't have a partner
 Sometimes I feel like
 My only friend
 Is the city I live in
 The city of angels?
 Lonely as I am
 Together we cry

 She's my companion
 I walk through her hills 'cause
 She knows who I am
 She sees my good deeds and
 She kisses me windy

 [Verse]
  
 Almost heaven, West Virginia,
 Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
                     Life is old there, older than the trees,
 Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze.
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Country roads, take me home,
         To the place I belong: 
       West Virginia, mountain momma,
          Take me home, country roads.
  
 [Verse]
  
 All my mem'ries, gather 'round her,
 Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
                  Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
 Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Country roads, take me home,
         To the place I belong:
       West Virginia, mountain momma,
          Take me home, country roads.
  
 [Bridge]
  
 I hear her voice, in the mornin' hours she calls me,
      The radio reminds me of my home far away.
      And drivin' down the road,
          I get a feelin' that I should have been home yesterday,
        yesterday.
  
 [Chorus]
  
          Country roads, take me home,

 [Verse 1]
      Way down in Louisiana down to New Orleans
  
 Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
        There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
        Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
      Who never ever learned to read or write so well
               But he could play a guitar just like he's ringin' a bell

 [Verse 2]
              He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack    
 And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track
      The engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
 Strummin' to the rhythm that the driver made
        When people passed him by they would stop and say
     Oh my that little country boy sure can play

 [Verse 1]
  
 Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
 But I still need love cause I'm just a man
 These nights never seem to go to plan
 I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
           Won't you stay with me?
             Cause you're all I need
            This ain't love it's clear to see
       But darling, stay with me
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Why am I so emotional?
 No it's not a good look, gain some self control
 And deep down I know this never works

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
            I let it fall, my heart
             And as it fell, you rose to claim it
          It was dark and I was over
             Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
      My hands, they're strong
          but my knees were far too weak
       To stand in your arms 
           without falling to your feet
  
 [Pre-chorus]
                 But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
            All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
           And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win
  
 [Chorus]
             But I set fire to the rain
              Watched it pour as I touched your face
           Well, it burned while I cried
            'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
  
 [Verse 2]
          When I lay with you
            I could stay there, close my eyes
            feel you here forever
          You and me together, nothing is better
  
 [Pre-chorus]
                    'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
          All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
          And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win
  
 [Chorus]
             But I set fire to the rain
              Watched it pour as I touched your face
            Well, it burned while I cried
   'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
         I set fire to the rain
              And I threw us into the flames
          When we fell, somethin' died
           'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time
  
 [Bridge]
            Sometimes I wake up by the door
                 That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
        Even now when we're already over
           I can't help myself from looking for you
  
 [Chorus]
         I set fire to the rain
              Watched it pour as I touched your face
           Well, it burned while I cried
    'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

 [Verse 1]
 I close my eyes and I can see
                 A world that's waiting up for me
         That I call my own
  Through the dark, through the door
                Through where no one's been before
          But it feels like home
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
 They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
 I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy
 We can live in a world that we design
  
 [Chorus]
         'Cause every night I lie in bed
      The brightest colors fill my head
    A million dreams are keeping me awake
    I think of what the world could be
    A vision of the one I see
    A million dreams is all it's gonna take
  N.C.
 A million dreams for the world we're gonna make
  
 [Verse 2]
 There's a house we can build
        Every room inside is filled
       With things from far away
  The special things I compile
           Each one there to make you smile
       On a rainy day

  They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
  They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
  I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
  Runaway to a world that we design

 Round yon virgin mother and child Holy infant so tender and mild
 Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace.

 Glories stream from heaven afar Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah

 Radiant beams from thy holy face With the dawn of redeeming grace
 Jesus lord at thy birth, Jesus lord at thy birth.

 (NOTES)
  
 1) When a chord is followed by a !, it means that you do not strum the chord
 but instead you play it in one quick downward motion.
 2) When a chord is followed by a *, it means that the chord has to be plucked.
 The plucking pattern is given below.
  
 (PLUCKING PATTERN)
  
 The plucking progression for Dm, Am and G goes like this
  
       e|---1-----|---0-----|------------|
 B|-----3---|-----1---|-----3------|
 G|-2-----2-|-2-----2-|-0-----0----|
 D|-0-------|-2-------|-0-------0--|
 A|-0-------|-0-------|-2----------|
 E|-0-------|-0-------|-3----------|
  
 Or this
  
      e|---------|---------|---------|
 B|-6-6-----|-5-5-----|-5-5-----|
 G|-7---7---|-5---5---|-4---4---|
 D|-7-----5-|-7-----7-|-5-----5-|
 A|-5-------|-7-------|-5-------|
 E|---------|-5-------|-3-------|
  
 The whistling bit can be played on the guitar but it doesn't sound too good.
  
 e|----------------------------|
 B|----0-1--1-1-------0-1-3-1--|
 G|--2----------2-2-2----------| x2
 D|----------------------------|
 A|----------------------------|
 E|----------------------------|
  
 The Dm, Am, G plucking is immediately picked up after the last note.
  
 e|-----0-1-0---------------------|
 B|-1-3---------------------------|

 I heard he sang a good song.
 I heard he had a style.
 And so I came to see him,
      and listen for a while.
 And there he was this young boy,
 a stranger to my eyes.

                              To finally drive up to your house
  
 But today I drove through the suburbs
                             Crying 'cause you weren't around
  
 [Verse 2]
   And you're probably with that blonde girl
  
 Who always made me doubt
   She's so much older than me
  
 She's everything I'm insecure about
          Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
                                      'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

      And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay
           now that I'm gone
  
        Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
         'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
  
 [Verse 3]
   And all my friends are tired
  
 of hearing how much I miss you, but
    I kinda feel sorry for them
  
 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
    Today I drove through the suburbs
                                 and pictured I was driving home to you

 Red lights, stop signs
 I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
 Can't drive past the places we used to go to
         'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe
       Oooooooooh
  
 Sidewalks we crossed
 I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
 over all the noise
          God I'm so blue, know we're through
      But I still fuckin' love you, babe

                     We passed upon the stair, we spoke in was and when
                     Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
                     Which came as a surprise, I spoke into his eyes
                       I thought you died alone, a long long time ago

                         I searched a foreign land, for years and years I roamed
                        I gazed a gazeless stare, we walked a million hills
                     I must have died alone, a long long time ago

 I want you by my side
 So that I never feel alone again
 They've always been so kind
 But now they've brought you away from here
 I hope they didn't get your mind
 Your heart is too strong anyway
 We need to fetch back the time
 They have stolen from us
  
  
 [CHORUS]
  
 And I want you
 We can bring it on the floor
               You've never danced like this before
           We don't talk about it
 Dancin' on, do the boogie all night long
 Stoned in paradise
 Shouldn't talk about it
  
 And I want you
 We can bring it on the floor
               You've never danced like this before
           We don't talk about it

 Coldest winter for me
 No sun is shining anymore
 The only thing I feel is pain
 Caused by absence of you
 Suspense is controlling my mind
 I cannot find the way out of here
 I want you by my side
 So that I never feel alone again

 [Verse 3]
  
   Have you come here for forgiveness?
      Have you come to raise the dead?
   Have you come here to play Jesus
      To the lepers in your head?
  
  Did I ask too much  more than a lot
      You gave me nothing now it's all I got
   We're one but we're  not the same
         Well we     hurt each other then we do it again

      You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl

                       When all you got is hurt one love  one blood

  Maybe surrounded by
  A million people I
  Still feel all alone

                And I've been keeping all the letters

               Well I would send them

 Oh misty eye of the Mountain below,
 Keep careful watch of my brothers’ souls,
 And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke,
 Keep watching over Durin’s sons.
  
  
  
 [VERSE 1]
  
                If this is to end in fire,
                Then we shall all burn together,
            Watch the flames climb higher,
 Into the night.
          Calling out father oh,
 Stand by and we will,
            Watch the flames burn auburn on
      The mountainside,
  
  
  
 [VERSE 2]
  
                   And if we should die tonight,
            We should all die together.
          Raise a glass of wine,
 For the last time.
          Calling out father oh,
     Prepare as we will,
            Watch the flames burn auburn on
      The mountainside.
     Desolation comes upon the sky.
  
  
 [CHORUS 1]
  
            Now I see fire,
 Inside the mountain.
        I see fire,
 Burning the trees.
            And I see fire,
 Hollowing souls.
        I see fire,
 Blood in the breeze.
  
 And I’ll hope that you’ll remember me.
  
  
  
 [VERSE 3]
  
               Oh should my people fall then,
         Surely I’ll do the same.
              Confined in mountain halls,
             We got too close to the flame.
          Calling out father oh,
 Hold fast and we will,
            Watch the flames burn auburn on
      The mountainside.
     Desolation comes upon the sky.
  
  
 [CHORUS 2]
  
            Now I see fire,
 Inside the mountain.
        I see fire,
 Burning the trees.
            And I see fire,
 Hollowing souls.
        I see fire,
 Blood in the breeze.
  
 And I’ll hope that you’ll remember me.
  
  
 [BRIDGE]
  
             And if the night is burning,
         I will cover my eyes,
             For if the dark returns,
          Then my brothers will die.
             And as the sky is falling down,
               It crashed into this lonely town.
                And with that shadow upon the ground,
            I hear my people screaming out.
  
  
 [CHORUS 3]
  
            And, I see fire,
 Inside the mountain.
        I see fire,
 Burning the trees.
            And I see fire,
 Hollowing souls.
        I see fire,
 Blood in the breeze.
        I see fire,
          (Oh you know I saw a city burning.)
 Fire.
            And I see fire
            (Feel the heat upon my skin.)

 [Verse]
        I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
             He’s got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
      The other on my heart
 I look around, turn the radio down
          He says baby is something wrong?
    I say nothing I was just thinking how we don’t have a song
  
 And he says...
  
 [Chorus]
 Our song is the slamming screen door,
 Sneakin’ out late, tapping on your window
 When you’re on the phone and you talk real slow
             Cause it’s late and your mama don’t know
                  Our song is the way you laugh
      The first date “man, I didn’t kiss her, but I should have”
 And when I got home ... before I said amen
            Asking God if he could play it again
  
 [Interlude]
  
 [Verse]
 I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
      Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
      And lost and thrown away
 Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin’ bed
    I almost didn’t notice all the roses
 And the note that said...
  
 [Chorus]
 Our song is the slamming screen door,
 Sneakin’ out late, tapping on your window
 When you’re on the phone and you talk real slow
             Cause it’s late and your mama don’t know
                  Our song is the way you laugh

 [Bridge]
       I’ve heard every album, listened to the radio
 Waited for something to come along
              That was as good as our song

 Cause our song is the slamming screen door
 Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
                    When we’re on the phone and he talks real slow

 Hello?
                   Is there anybody in there?
                      Just nod if you can hear me
           Is there anyone at home?
 Come on now
                I hear you're feeling down
 I can ease your pain
              And get you on your feet again
 Relax
                      I'll need some information first
 Just the basic facts
          Can you show me where it hurts?
  
 [Chorus]
 There is no pain you are receding
 A distant ship smoke on the horizon
    You are only coming through in waves
    Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
       When I was a child I had a fever
     My hands felt just like two balloons
   Now I've got that feeling once again, I can't explain,
            You would not understand, This is not how I am
  
 I               have become comfortably numb.

 Can you stand up?

 Out of the corner of my eye
     I turned to look but it was gone
                     I cannot put my finger on it now
                          The child is grown, The dream is gone
  
 And  I           have become comfortably numb.

 Heart beat fast, colors and promises

                            To fall, but watching you stand alone
            All of my doubt, suddenly goes away somehow
               One Step Closer

 Darling don't be afraid, I have loved you

            I will be brave, I will not let any-thing
 Take away, whats standing in front of me

 [Verse 1]
  
 There was a time when I was alone
 Nowhere to go and no place to call home
 My only friend was the man in the moon
      And even sometimes he would go away too
 Then one night as I closed my eyes
 I saw a shadow flyin' high
 He came to me with the sweetest smile
 Told me he wanted to talk for a while
          He said,   ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me.
   I promise that you'll never be lonely.""
      And ever since that day
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
    I am a lost boy,  from Neverland
 Usually hangin' out with   Peter Pan
    And when we're bored we play in the woods
 Always on the run from   Captain Hook
 ""Run, run, lost boy"", they say to me
   Away from all of   reality
 Neverland is home to lost boys like me
      And lost boys like me are free
  
 Neverland is home to lost boys like me
      And lost boys like me are free
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
     He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
    Believe in him, and believe in me
    Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
 To your beautiful destiny
        As we soared above the town that never loved me
    I realized I finally had a family
 Soon enough we reached Neverland
 Peacefully my feet hit the sand
      And ever since that day
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
    I am a lost boy,  from Neverland
 Usually hangin' out with   Peter Pan
    And when we're bored we play in the woods
 Always on the run from   Captain Hook
 ""Run, run, lost boy"", they say to me
   Away from all of   reality

      And lost boys like me are free

                                     Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
            When I'm with you
            I could stay there,
            Close my eyes, feel you're here forever,
            You and me together, nothing is better
  
  
 [Pre-chorus]
  
                But there's a side to you that I never knew, I never knew.
             All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
            And the games you'd play, you would always, always win.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
            But I set fire to the rain,
           Watch it pour as I touched your face,
           Well, it burned while I cried,
                                      Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
        I set fire to the rain
        And I threw us into the flames
          Where I felt something die,
                                      Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
           Sometimes I wake up by the door,
                That heart you caught, must be waiting for you,
       Even now when we're already over,
           I can't help myself from looking for you
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
        I set fire to the rain,
           Watch it pour as I touch your face,
           Well, it burned when I cried,
                                 Cause I heard it screaming your name, your name
        I set fire to the rain,
        And I threw us into the flames
          Where I felt something die,

 Verse 1
  My lover's got humor, she's the giggle at a funeral
                           Knows everybody's disapproval, I should've worshipped her sooner
                      If the Heavens ever did speak, she’s the last true mouthpiece
                          Every Sunday's getting more bleak, a fresh poison each week
                    We were born sick, you heard them say it
  My church offers no absolutes, she tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
                          The only heaven I'll be sent to is when I'm alone with you
                 I was born sick, but I love it. Command me to be well

 Verse 2
  If I'm a pagan of the good times, my lover's the sunlight
                         To keep the Goddess on my side she demands a sacrifice
                     Drain the whole sea, get something shiny
  Something meaty for the main course, that's a fine looking high horse
                       What you got in the stable? We've a lot of starving faithful
                   That looks tasty, that looks plenty, this is hungry work
  
  
  
 Chorus
 N.C.*          Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                  I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife

               Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                  I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife

 Bridge
  No masters or kings when the ritual begins
            There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
          In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
         Only then I am human, only then I am clean     Oh
  
 Oh   Amen  Amen  Amen

                    You're gonna believe them
                   And when you're fifteen
     And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
       But in your life you'll do things greater than
               Dating the boy on the football team
                But I didnt know it at fifteen

 [Bridge]
  
  When all you wanted was to be wanted
                               Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
  
  
 [Verse]
  
  Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
          But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
        And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy 
                    Who changed his mind and we both cried
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                      'Cause when you're fifteen and 
  Somebody tells you they love you
                    You're gonna believe them
                   And when you're fifteen
     Don't forget to look before you fall
  I've found time can heal most anything
                       And you just might find who you're supposed to be
             I didn't know who I was supposed to be
  At fifteen

 [Verse 1]
     It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
  If'n you don't know by now
         An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
   It'll never do somehow
            When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
  Look out your window and I'll be gone
 You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
 Don't think twice, it's all right
  
  
  
  
 [Verse 2]
         And it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
       That light I never knowed
         An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
  I'm on the dark side of the road
          But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
     To try and make me change my mind and stay
 We never did too much talkin' anyway
 Don't think twice, it's all right
  
  
  
  
 [Verse 3]
         No, it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
  Like you never did before
         And it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
  I can't hear you anymore
        I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' down the road
    I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
    I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
 Don't think twice, it's all right
  
  
  
  
 [Verse 4]
     So loooooong, honey babe
            Where I'm bound, I can't tell
      But goodbye's too good a word, babe
  So I'll just say fare thee well
 I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
      You could have done better but I don't mind
 You just kinda wasted my precious time
      But don't think twice, it's all right

        Not a footprint to be seen

  Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried

 Up here in the cold thin air
    I finally can breathe
    I know I left a life behind but I'm too relieved to grieve

 [Verse 1]
 Thought I found a way
 Thought I found a way, out (out)
       But you never go away (never go away)
       So I guess I gotta stay now
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
                   Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
              Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
                   Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
               Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
  
 [Chorus]
 Isn't it lovely, all alone
 Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
 Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
    Hello, welcome home
  
 [Verse 2]
 Walkin' out of time
 Lookin' for a better place (lookin' for a better place)
 Something's on my mind
 Always in my headspace

         Of the things that could go wrong along the way
             You'll get by with a smile

 [Verse]
                  When I look into your eyes, It's like watching the night sky,
               Or a beautiful sunrise. There's so much they hold.
                   And just like them old stars, I see that you've come so far,
                  To be right where you are. How old is your soul?
  
 [Chorus]
               I won't give up on us, even if the skies get rough.
                 I'm giving you all my love. I'm still looking up.
  
 [Verse]
                         And when you're needing your space, to do some navigating,
              I'll be here patiently waiting, to see what you find.

                                              the tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake.
             And in the end you're still my friend, at least we did intend
  
 for us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn.
         We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in.
   I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not and who I am.
  
 [Chorus]
               I won't give up on us, even if the skies get rough.
                 I'm giving you all my love. I'm still looking up.
                Still looking up.
  
              I won't give up on us (no I'm not... giving up)
                 God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough... I am loved)
               We've got a lot to learn (we're alive... we are loved)
                   God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)
  
               I won't give up on us, even if the skies get rough.

            Are all made of gold

 aku kesal dengan jarak
 yang sering memisahkan kita
 hingga aku hanya bisa
 berbincang denganmu di whatsapp
  
 aku kesal dengan waktu
 yang tak mau berhenti bergerak
 ba..rang sejenak

      menggenggam erat jari-jarimu

                    Away from all the fears
              And all the faults you've left behind

 On the noose around your neck

 [Verse 1]
   I fell by the wayside, like everyone else
   I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
   Our every moment, I start to replace
   ‘cause now that they’re gone all I hear are the words that I needed to say
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
   When you hurt under the surface
   Like troubled water running cold
                              Well time can heal but this won't
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
 So
             Before you go
                Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
     If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
 So
             Before you go
                Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
      It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
 So
             Before you go
  
  
 [Verse 2]
   Was never the right time, whenever you called
   Went little by little by little, until there was nothing at all
   Our every moment, I start to replay
   When all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  When you hurt under the surface
  Like troubled water running cold
                              Well time can heal but this won't

 [Verse]
   There's no combination of words
          I could put on the back of a postcard
   No song that I could sing
      But I can try for your heart,
   Our dreams, and they are made out of real things
         Like a shoe box of photographs
       With sepia-toned loving
   Love is the answer
               At least for most of the questions in my heart like
   Why are we here? And where do we go?
                    And how come it's so hard?
   It's not always easy and
            Sometimes life can be deceiving
   I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together
  
 [Chorus]
   Mmmm, it's always better when we're together
   Yeah, we'll look at the stars and we're together
   Well, it's always better when we're together
   Yeah, it's always better when we're together
  
 [Interlude]
  
 [Verse]
                   And all of these moments
             Just might find their way into my dreams tonight,
        But I know that they’ll be gone
           When the morning light sings
             And brings new things
        For tomorrow night you see
       That they’ll be gone too,
           Too many things I have to do
                      But if all of these dreams might find their way
          Into my day to day scene
         I'd be under the impression
        I was somewhere in between
            With only two,
              Just me and you,
              Not so many things we got to do
     Or places we got to be
              We'll sit beneath the mango tree, now
  
 [Chorus]
   Yeah, it's always better when we're together
   Mmmm, we're somewhere in between together
   Well, it's always better when we're together

   So pretty when I sleep hey now and
   When I wake up you look so
      Pretty sleeping next to me but there is
   Not enough time there is no
   No song I could sing and there is no
   Combination of words I could say
             But I will still tell you one thing
 We're better together

 Sat by the river, and it made me complete

 I felt the branches of it looking at me
 Is this the place we used to love?

 [Verse 1]
 When I look into your eyes
                      I can see a love restrained
 But darling when I hold you
                            Don't you know I feel the same
 Cause nothin' lasts forever
                              And we both know hearts can change
 And it's hard to hold a candle
                       In the cold November rain
  
 [Verse 2]
 We've been through this such a long, long time
                          Just tryin' to kill the pain, oh yeah
 But lovers always come and lovers always go
      And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
 If we could take the time to lay it on the line
 I could rest my head
                             Just knowin' that you were mine, all mine
 So if you want to love me
                     Then darlin' don't refrain
 Or I'll just end up walkin'
                       In the cold November rain

 Do you need some time on your own?
         Do you need some time all alone?
            Everybody needs some time on their own
                     Don't you know you need some time all alone
  
 [Bridge]
 I know it's hard to keep an open heart
 When even friends seem out to harm you
 But if you could heal a broken heart
 Wouldn't time be out to charm you
  
 [Chorus]
 Sometimes I need some time on my own
              Sometimes I need some time all alone
            Everybody needs some time on their own
                     Don't you know you need some time all alone
  
 [Verse 3]
 And when your fears subside
 And shadows still remain, oh yeah
 I know that you can love me
                              When there's no one left to blame
 So never mind the darkness
                      We still can find a way
 Cause nothin' lasts forever

                               He said...
  
 [Verse 1]
      ...""Son, have you seen the world?
                       Well, what would you say
                     If I said that you could?
                  Just carry this gun,
                  You'll even get paid."".
                             I said ""That sounds pretty good.""
  
 [Verse 2]
                Black leather boots,
                  Spit-shined, so bright.
                  They cut off my hair,
                 But it looks alright.
                    We marched and we sang.
                We all became friends,
                       As we learned how to fight.
  
 [Chorus 1]
            A hero of war!
                         Yeah, that's what I'll be.
                  And when I come home,
                           They'll be damn proud of me.
                  I'll carry this flag;
                      To the  grave, if I must.
                            'Cause it's a flag that I love
                     And it's flag that  I trust.
  
 [Verse 3]
                  I kicked in the door,
              I yelled my commands.
                     The children, they cried,
               But I got my man.
              We took him away,
                 A bag over his face,
                          From his family and his friends.
  
 [Verse 4]
                    They took off his clothes,
                     They pissed in his hands.
                 I told them to stop,
                     But then, I joined in.
                   We beat him with guns
                       And batons, not just once,
                 But again and again.
  
 [Chorus 1]
            A hero of war!
                         Yeah, that's what I'll be.
                  And when I come home,
                           They'll be damn proud of me.
                  I'll carry this flag;
                      To the  grave, if I must.
                            'Cause it's a flag that I love
                     And I flag that  I trust.

 [Verse 5]
     ...walked through bullets and haze.
                 I asked her to stop;
                  I begged her to stay.
                  But she pressed on,
                 So I lifted my gun
              And I fired away...
  
 [Verse 6]
          And the shells
                     Jumped through the smoke.
               And into the sand,
                         That the blood now had soaked,
          She collapsed,
                     With a flag in her hand.
                  A flag white as snow.
  
 [Chorus 2]
            A hero of war!
                    Is that what they see?
                 Just medals and scars?
                   So damn proud of me.
                          And I brought home that flag.
                 Now it gathers dust.
                         But it's a flag that I love.
                       It's the only flag I trust.

                 A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
                They're gonna rip it off
               Taking their time right behind my back
          And I'm talking to myself at night

 Back and forth through my mind

            Everyone knows about it

     Hello, it's me.
         I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet, to go over everything
                 They say that time's supposed to heal you, but I ain't done much healing.
    Hello, can you hear me?
         I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be when we were younger and free.
           I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet.

         and a million miles.

 Hello from the other side,
    I must've called a thousand times to tell you
 I'm sorry, for everything that I've done,
              But when I call you never seem to be home.
 Hello from the outside,
     At least I can say that I've tried to tell you
 I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
                   But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore.

 Pagi ke pagi ku terjebak di dalam ambisi
 Seperti orang orang berdasi yang gila materi
 Rasa bosan membukakan jalan mencari peran
 Keluarlah dari zona nyaman

 Sembilu yang dulu biarlah berlalu
 Bekerja bersama hati, kita ini insan bukan seekor sapi
 Sembilu yang dulu biarlah membiru
 Berkarya bersama hati

 Waktu ke waktu perlahan ku rakit egoku
 Merangkul orang orang yang mulai sejiwa denganku
 Ke BM an membukakan jalan mencari teman
 Bergeraklah dari zona nyaman

 Bekerja bersama hati
 kita ini insan bukan seekor sapi

 Bekerja bersama hati, kita ini insan bukan seekor sapi
 Sembilu yang dulu biarlah membiru
 Sembilu yang dulu biarlah membiru
 Berkarya bersama hati, kita ini insan bukan seekor sapi
 Tanamkan pesanku agar tak keliru
 Bekerja bersama hati

                    Kamukha mo si Paraluman,
   Nung tayo ay bata pa.
   At ang galing-galing mo sumayaw,
        Mapa boogie man o cha-cha.
              Ngunit ang paborito,
         Ay pagsayaw mo ng el bimbo.
           Nakakaindak, nakakaaliw,
            Nakakatindig balahibo.
    Pagkagaling sa skwela ay didiretso na sa inyo,
    At buong maghapon ay tinuturuan mo ako.
  
 [Chorus]
        Magkahawak ang ating kamay,
        At walang kamalay-malay.

       Na umibig ng tunay.

                          Naninigas ang aking katawan,
      Pagumikot na ang plaka.
   Patay sa kembot ng bewang mo,
          At ang pungay ng iyong mga mata.
         Lumiliwanag ang buhay,
          Habang tayo'y magkaakbay.
            At dahan-dahang dumudulas, 
            Ang kamay ko sa makinis mong braso.
    Sana noon pa man ay sinabi na sa iyo,
    Kahit hindi na uso ay ito lang ang alam ko.

      Ngunit walang asawa.
       Tagahugas ka raw ng pinggan

             At isang gabi nasagasaan,

   Lahat ng pangarap ko'y bigla lang natunaw,

   A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
 Miles away from those I love purpose hard to find
 While I recall all the words you spoke to me
        Can't help but wish that I was there
        Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah
  
 [Chorus]
 Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
      to hold her when I'm not around,
            when I'm much too far away
 We all need that person who can be true to you
         But I left her when I found her
      And now I wish I'd stayed

        I'm missing you again oh no
             Once again

 There's nothing here for me on this barren road
          There's no one here while the city sleeps
        and all the shops are closed
 Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
 Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah

 Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
       to hold her when I'm not around,

 Before long, they waste away
 I found you, something told me to stay
 I gave in, to selfish ways

 I see the crystal raindrops fall,
             and the beauty of it all
             Is when the sun comes shining through
 To make those rainbows in my mind,
               When I think of you sometime,
                And I want to spend some time with you.

 Just the two of us,   you and I.

 We look for love, no time for tears,
             wasted water's all that is,
            And it don't make no flowers grow.
 Good things might come to those who wait,
                   But not for those who wait too late
               We've got to go for all we know.

 [Verse 1]
    I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
    I thought about our last kiss how it felt the way you tasted
      And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
          Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you
          When he says those words that hurt you do you read the ones I wrote you?
  
      Sometimes I start to wonder was it just a lie?
     If what we had was real how could you be fine?
  
 Cause I'm not fine at all
  
 [Chorus]
      I remember the day you told me you were leaving
      I remember the makeup running down your face
          And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
       Like every single wish we ever made
  
    I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
         And forget about the stupid little things
           Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
          And the memories I never can escape
                            Cause I'm not fine at all
  
 [Verse 2]
      The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
         I'll admit I like to see them I'll admit I feel alone
 All my friends keep asking why I'm not around
     It hurts to know you're happy and it hurts that you've moved on
       It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long
  
       It's like we never happened was it just a lie?
     If what we had was real how could you be fine?
  
 Cause I'm not fine at all
  
 [Chorus]
    I remember the day you told me you were leaving
    I remember the makeup running down your face
          And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
       Like every single wish we ever made
  
    I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
         And forget about the stupid little things
           Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
          And the memories I never can escape
  
 [Bridge]
       If today I woke up with you right beside me
       Like all of this was just some twisted dream
      I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
            And you'd never slip away
            And you'd never hear me say
  
 [Chorus]
      I remember the day you told me you were leaving
    I remember the makeup running down your face
          And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them

   Steal some covers, share some skin
   Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable,
      you twist to fit the mold that I am in
      But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
              and I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
       That someday it would lead me back to you
       That someday it would lead me back to you

   Fingers trace your every outline
   Paint a picture with my hands
   Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
             Change the weather, still together when it ends

         it's a long day livin' in Reseda
            there's a free-way runnin' through the yard

 When tomorrow comes
 I'll be on my own
 Feeling frightened of
                           The things that I don't know
 When tomorrow comes, tomorrow comes
 Tomorrow comes
  
 And though the road is long
 I look up to the sky
 And in the dark I found, lost hope that I won't fly
 And I sing along, I sing along, and I sing along

       and adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had sh*t
   give away a few Mercedes like here lady have this
       and last but not least grant somebody their last wish
      it's been a couple months that I've been single so

   then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
 toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
 but keep the fives, twentys completely separate
 and yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
   we in recession but let me take a crack at it
       I'll probably take whatevers left and just split it up
   so everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
 and not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
   eating good sleeping soundly
     I know we all have a similar dream
 go in your pocket pull out your wallet
     and put it in the air and sing

         Let me hold you
          For the last time
           It's the last chance to feel again
          But you broke me
        Now I can't feel anything

 I can almost see it
  
 That dream I’m dreaming but
 There’s a voice inside my head sayin,
 You’ll never reach it,
 Every step I’m taking,
  
 Every move I make feels
 Lost with no direction
 My faith is shaking but
 I got to keep trying
          Got to keep my head held high
  
 [Chorus]
 There’s always going to be another mountain
  
 I’m always going to want to make it move
 Always going to be an uphill battle,
 Sometimes you going to have to lose,
 Ain’t about how fast I get there,

 The struggles I’m facing,
  
 The chances I’m taking
 Sometimes they knock me down but

 Just got to keep going
      And I,
               I got to be strong
 Just keep pushing on,

 Alaala’y bumabalik
          Mga panahong nasasabik
 Sukdulang mukha ay
 Laging nasa panaginip
  
 Bakit biglang pinagpalit
 Pagsasamaha'y tila nawaglit
 Ang dating walang hanggan
 Nagkaroon ng katapusan

 Hindi magbabago
 Pagmamahal sa iyo
 Sana’y pakinggan mo

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
                      Oh, there she goes again, every morning it's the same,
               You walk on by my house, I wanna call out your name.
 I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standing,
               You got me thinking what we could be 'cause
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 I keep craving, craving you,
 You don't know it but it's true,
 Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you.
 This is typical of love,
                             Can't wait anymore, I won't wait I need to tell ya how I feel when I see us together forever.
  
  
 [Chorus]
          In my dreams, you're with me,
           We'll be everything I want us to be.
           And from there, who knows?
          Maybe this will be the night that we kiss,
 For the first time.
          Or is that just me in my i-magina-tion?
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 We walked, we laughed, we spent our time, walking by the ocean side,
 My hands are gently intertwined, a feeling I just can't describe.
 All this time we spent alone, thinking we could not belong,
                           To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful.

 I keep craving, craving you,

           We'll be everything I want us to be.

 It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone

 NOTE: some tabs use an F#m in the first 2 lines of the verse, I think the Bm sounds
 better.
  
  
 [Intro]
  
 [Verse]
 Hey there Delilah, What’s it like in New York City? 
        I’m a thousand miles away, But girl tonight you look so pretty, 
          Yes you do, Time Square can’t shine as bright as you, 
               I swear it’s true. 
 Hey there Delilah, Don’t you worry about the distance, 
            I’m right there if you get lonely, Give this song another listen, 
             Close your eyes, Listen to my voice it’s my disguise, 
              I’m by your side. 
  
 [Chorus]
 Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
 Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
                 What you do to me. 
  
 [Verse]
 Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard, 
             But just believe me girl some day, I'll pay the bills with this guitar, 
                We'll have it good, We'll have the life we knew we would, 
             My word is good. 
 Hey there Delilah, I’ve got so much left to say, 
           If every simple song I wrote to you, Would take your breath away, 
               I’d write it all, Even more in love with me you’d fall, 
               We’d have it all. 
  
 [Chorus]
 Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
 Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
  
 [Bridge]
 A thousand miles seems pretty far, But they’ve got planes and trains and cars, 
 I’d walk to you if I had no other way 
 Our friends would all make fun of us, And we'll just laugh along because, 
     We know that none of them have felt this way, 
 Delilah I can promise you, That by the time that we get through, 
      The world will never ever be the same, And you’re to blame. 
  
 [Verse 3]
 Hey there Delilah you be good, And don’t you miss me, 
           Two more years and you’ll be done with school, And I'll be making history, 
         Like I do, You’ll know it's all because of you, 
 We can do whatever we want to, 
 Hey there Delilah here's to you, This one’s for you. 
  
 [Outro]
 Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
 Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me,

 First tab written down properly, so it's a bit scratchy. Seems like a lot of chords,
 but once you figure it out it's all simple progressions and patterns, nice and easy :)
 Am working on tabbing the lead, but will take a while as I'm only a rhythm guitarist.

 I wish I could be the perfect daughter

        Every turn I take, every trail I track
        Every path I make, every road leads back
         To the place I know, where I can not go
           Where I long to be

          See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
             And no one knows, how far it goes
         If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
               One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

 [Verse 2]
 I know, everybody on this island seems so happy on this island
                  Everything is by design
 I know, everybody on this island has a role on this island
                        So maybe I can roll with mine
        I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
          I'll be satisfied if I play along

          What is wrong with me?

 He is jealous for me,
 Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree,
 Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy.
 When all of a sudden,
                        I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
        And I realize just how beautiful You are,
          And how great Your affections are for me.

 We are His portion and He is our prize,
 Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes,
 If grace is an ocean, we’re all sinking.
 So Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss,
 And my heart turns violently inside of my chest,
 I don’t have time to maintain these regrets,
 When I think about, the way…

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
      The club isn't the best place to find a lover
         So the bar is where I go (mm-mm-mm-mm)
 Me and my friends at the table doing shots
           Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mm-mm-mm-mm)
       Come over and start up a conversation with just me
      And trust me I'll give it a chance now
          Take my hand, stop, put Van the man on the jukebox
      And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 Girl, you know I want your love
 Your love was handmade for somebody like me
               Come on now, follow my lead
 I may be crazy, don't mind me, say
 Boy, let's not talk too much
 Grab on my waist and put that body on me
               Come on now, follow my lead
       Come-come on now, follow my lead, mm-mm-mm
  
 [Chorus]
   I'm in love with the shape of you
              We push and pull like a magnet do
              Although my heart is falling too
         I'm in love with your body
           And last night you were in my room
             And now my bedsheets smell like you
                   Every day discovering something brand new
               Well, I'm in love with your body

 [Verse 2]
 One week in we let the story begin
              We're going out on our first date
          You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
               Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
              We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
               And how your family is doin' okay
                Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat

 [Verse 1]
  
   Beauty queen of only eighteen
    She had some trouble with herself
   He was always there to help her
     She always belonged to someone else
  
   I drove for miles and miles
      And wound up at your door
   I’ve had you so many times but somehow
         I want more
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   I don’t mind spending everyday
   Out on your corner in the pouring rain
   Look for the girl with the broken smile
   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
          And she will be loved
          And she will be loved
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
   Tap on my window knock on my door
   I want to make you feel beautiful
   I know I tend to get so insecure
   It doesn’t matter anymore
  
   It’s not always rainbows and butterflies
       It’s compromise that moves us along, yeah
   My heart is full and my door’s always open
          You can come anytime you want
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   I don’t mind spending everyday
   Out on your corner in the pouring rain
   Look for the girl with the broken smile
   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
          And she will be loved
      She will be loved
          And she will be loved
          And she will be loved
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
   I know where you hide 
                Alone in your car
                  Know all of the things that make you who you are
                  I know that goodbye means nothing at all
                         Comes back and begs me catch her every time she falls... yeah
  
  
 [Break]
  
   Tap on my window knock on my door
    I want to make you feel beautiful
  
 *short pause*
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   I don’t mind spending everyday
   Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
   Look for the girl with the broken smile
   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
          And she will be loved
          And she will be loved

 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 [Verse 1]
 I remember years ago
 Someone told me I should take
 Caution when it comes to love
 I did, I did
 And you were strong and I was not
 My illusion, my mistake
 I was careless, I forgot
 I did
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
       And now when all is done
                       There is nothing to say
                                  You have gone and so effortlessly
  
 You have won
                    You can go ahead tell them
  
 [Chorus]
                   Tell them all I know now
                     Shout it from the rooftops
                    Write it on the skyline
                 All we had is gone now
                   Tell them I was happy
                  And my heart is broken
                    All my scars are open
                    Tell them what I hoped would be
          Impossible, impossible
          Impossible, impossible
  
 [Verse 2]
 Falling out of love is hard
 Falling for betrayal is worse
 Broken trust and broken hearts
 I know, I know
 Thinking all you need is there
 Building faith on love and words
 Empty promises will wear
 I know (i know)
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
       And now when all is done
                       There is nothing to say
                                       And if you're done with embarrassing me
  
 On your own
                    You can go ahead tell them
  
 [Chorus]
                   Tell them all I know now
                     Shout it from the rooftops
                    Write it on the skyline
                 All we had is gone now
                   Tell them I was happy
                  And my heart is broken
                    All my scars are open

 [Verse 1]
      Old pirates, yes, they rob I.
      Sold I to the merchant ships
  Minutes after they took I    from the bottomless pit.
         But my hand was made strong
  By the hand of the Almighty.
       We forward in this generation   triumphantly.

        How long shall they kill our prophets

        We've got to fulfill the book.

 [Intro Chorus]
      She played the fiddle in an Irish band
          But she fell in love with an English man
 Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
       Said baby I just want to dance
  
 [Verse 1]
               I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
               She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
               She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
              Said it was one of my friend’s songs do you want to drink on?
  
           She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
          She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding a shotgun
 Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
           Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know
  
 [Chorus 1]
      She played the fiddle in an Irish band
          But she fell in love with an English man
 Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
       Said baby I just want to dance
                        With my pretty little Galway Girl
                          You’re my pretty little Galway Girl
  
 [Verse 2]
               You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
               And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
          As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
        After dancing to Ceili singing to trad tunes
  
          I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
       A cappella in the bar using her feet for the beat
              Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
              And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me, you know
  
 [Chorus 2]
      She played the fiddle in an Irish band
          But she fell in love with an English man
 Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

  My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
  My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
  
 [Verse 3]
            Now we’ve outstayed our welcome and it’s closing time
       I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
      Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
        As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
  
   I walked her home then she took me inside
         Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
    I swear I’m going to put you in a song that I write
          About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
  
 [Chorus 3]
      She played the fiddle in an Irish band
          But she fell in love with an English man
 Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
       Said baby I just want to dance
  
                        With my pretty little Galway Girl

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse]
 Once upon a time you dressed so fine
      You threw the bums a dime in your prime,   didn't you?
   People'd call, say, ""Beware doll, 
         you're bound to fall"" You thought they were all  a kiddin' you
  
   You used to   laugh about
   Everybody that was   hangin' out
  
  Now you don't talk so loud
  Now you don't seem so proud
  
       About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
  
 [Chorus]
                  How does it feel
                  How does it feel
                      To be without a home
                         Like a complete unknown
                       Like a rolling stone
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Verse]
             Aww, You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
          But you know you only used to get   juiced in it
    Nobody has ever taught you how to live out on the street
                 And now you're gonna have to get   used to it
  
   You said you'd never  compromise
   With the mystery tramp, but now you  realize
  
  He's not selling any  alibis
  As you stare into the vacuum  of his eyes
  
      And say do you want to  make a deal?
  
 [Chorus]
                  How does it feel
                  How does it feel
                   To be on your own
                        With no direction home
                    A complete unknown
                      Like a rolling stone
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Verse]
          Aww, You never turned around to see the frowns 
                          On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did   tricks for you
      You never understood that it ain't no good
      You shouldn't let other people get your   kicks for you
  
   You used to ride on the chrome horse with your   diplomat
   Who carried on his shoulder a   Siamese cat
  
  Ain't it hard  when you discover that
  He really wasn't  where it's at
       After he took from you everything  he could steal.
  
 [Chorus]
                  How does it feel
                  How does it feel
                         To have you on your own
                        With no direction home
                        Like a complete unknown
                      Like a rolling stone
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Verse]
     Aww, Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
              They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they   got it made
  Exchanging all precious gifts
                   But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
  
   You used to be so amused
   At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
  
  Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
  When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
          You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
  
 [Chorus]
                  How does it feel
                  How does it feel
                   To be on your own
                        With no direction home
                        Like a complete unknown

         You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
         You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
         You're givin' me a million reasons
  
 Give me a million reasons
 Givin' me a million reasons
 About a million reasons
  
 If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
 If you could find a dryway, I'd forever be still
             But you're giving me a million reasons
  
 Give me a million reasons
 Givin' me a million reasons

 I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away

 Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
 It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware

 Give me a million reasons
 Givin' me a million reasons
 About a million reasons
  
      And if you say something that you might even mean
       It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe

 [Verse 1]
   I was so high I did not recognize
                   the fire burning in her eyes, the chaos that controlled my mind...
   Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
             Never to return again but always in my heart

 She said goodbye too many times before
   Her heart is breaking in front of me

   I tried my best to feed her appetite
                  Keep her coming every night
                      So hard to keep her satisfied
   Kept playing love like it was just a game
                Pretending to feel the same
                       Then turn around and leave again

   Repair your broken wings
   And make sure everything's alright

 There's a calm surrender
 To the rush of day
 When the heat of a rolling wind
 Can be turned away
 An enchanted moment
 And it sees me through
 It's enough for this restless warrior
 Just to be with you
  
 [Chorus]
      And can you feel the love tonight?
   It is where we   are
   It's enough   for this wide-eyed wanderer
 That we got this far

 Beats in time with yours

 Song: Sign of the Times
 Key: F major
 Tempo: 60 BPM
 Tuning: E Standard
 Capo: None OR 5th Fret (transpose down 5)
  
 Tabbed by: Matty Sievers

 ----------------------------------------------
 Such an amazing song yet so simple!
  
 From the start to the bridge (4:01) it's Fmaj for 1 bar, Dmin for 1 bar and then Cmaj for 2 bars.
 Then from there, the bridge is Fmaj, Dmin, Cmaj and Bbmaj for 1 bar each until 4:49 then it goes back to
 the normal progression for four bars but on those last four, you use the bridge chords.
 So rather than C for two bars before the end on F, it's C and Bb for one bar each.
  
 This will all be in the chords below though; just giving you a basic outline before diving in.
 I'm playing this with no capo as it's fairly easy but if you aren't keen on the Dmin or the Bb
 you can transpose this down by 5, put your capo on 5th and have a fun time playing in the basic
 C fingering postions. That is probably best if your gonna solo this as an acoustic singer and
 need to focus on scrunching your face up when you sing. :P
  
 Edit: Lyrics have been fixed.
  
 Edit #2: Upon closer inspection and a few more sit downs at the piano and the guitar there is most
 certainly a C7 chord in there and have added it in. However, it also sounds fairly good without it so do
 what you are comfortable with.

 Just stop your crying
                     It’s a sign of the times
                 Welcome to the final show
  
 Hope you’re wearing your best clothes
 You can't bribe the door
                     On your way to the sky
                  You look pretty good down here
  
 But you ain't really good...
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 If we never learn we've been here before
 Why are we always stuck and
                     running from the bullets
         The bullets...
  
   We never learn we've been here before
 Why are we always stuck and

                We gotta get away from here
 Just stop your crying
              It’ll be alright
                        They told me that the end is near
                We gotta get away from here
  
 [Verse 2]
 Just stop your crying
                        Have the time of your life
                       Breakin' through the atmosphere
  
 Things look pretty good from here
  
 Remember everything will be alright
                 We could meet again somewhere.
  
 Somewhere far away from here.
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
   We never learn we've been here before
 Why are we always stuck and

  We don't talk enough
   We should open up
  Before it's all too much
  Will we ever learn
  We've been here before
  It's just what we know

 Stop your crying, baby

                         I don't deserve to have you…
      My smile was taken long ago / If I can change I hope I never know
  
 [Pre-Verse]
  
 [Verse]
      I still press your letters to my lips
       And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
     I couldn't face a life without your light
      But all of that was ripped apart… when you refused to fight
  
 [Chorus]
                                  So save your breath, I will not hear. I think I made it very clear.
                            You couldn't hate enough to love. Is that supposed to be enough?
                              I only wish you weren't my friend. Then I could hurt you in the end.
                            I never claimed to be a Saint…
      My own was banished long ago / It took the Death of Hope to let you go
  
 [Solo]
  
 [Chorus]
                                So Break Yourself Against My Stones
                           And Spit Your Pity In My Soul
                       You Never Needed Any Help
                           You Sold Me Out To Save Yourself
                         And I Won't Listen To Your Shame
                              You Ran Away - You're All The Same
                     Angels Lie To Keep Control…

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse]
  Say you're sorry 
         That face of an angel
        Comes out just when you need it to 
  As I paced back and forth all this time 
            'Cause I honestly believed in you 
 Holding on 
       The days drag on 
          Stupid girl
                                           I should have known, I should have known 
  
  
 [Chorus]
                 That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale 
              I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
   Lead her up the stairwell 
             This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
          I was a dreamer before you went and let me down 
           Now it's too late for you 
             And your white horse, to come around 
  
 [Verse]
  Maybe I was naive
  Got lost in your eyes 
      And never really had a chance 
  My mistake I didn't know to be in love 
             You had to fight to have the upper hand 
        I had so many dreams 
        About you and me 
        Happy endings, now I know 
  
  
 [Chorus]
                   That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale 
              I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
   Lead her up the stairwell 
             This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
            I was a dreamer before you went and let me down 
           Now it's too late for you 
             And your white horse, to come around 
  
  
 [Bridge]
  And there you are on your knees
  Begging for forgiveness, begging for me 
  Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry 
  
  
 [Chorus]
                      'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale 
            I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well 
            This is a big world, that was a small town 
              There in my rearview mirror disappearing now 
           And it's too late for you and your white horse 
           Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now 
  
  
 [Outro]
  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa 
  Try and catch me now 
     Oh, it's too late 
  To catch me now

 [Verse]
  
 Do you hear me, I'm talking to you
              Across the water across the deep blue ocean
            Under the open sky
    Oh my, baby I'm trying
  
        Boy I hear you in my dreams
              I feel you whisper across the sea
             I keep you with me in my heart
                You make it easier when life gets hard

 They don't know how long it takes
 Waiting for a love like this
 Every time we say goodbye
 I wish we had one more kiss
 I'll wait for you I'll promise you, I will            (I'm)

             And so I'm sailing through the sea
        To an island where we'll meet
                  You'll hear the music, fill the air
             I'll put a flower in your hair
  
                 And though the breezes through trees
          Move so pretty, you're all I see
         As the world keeps spinning round
      You hold me right here, right now

 Ku terima suratmu
      tlah ku baca dan aku mengerti
 Betapa merindunya
 dirimu akan hadirnya diriku
    Di dalam hari-harimu bersama lagi
  
 Kau tanyakan padaku
   kapan aku Akan kembali lagi
 Katamu kau tak kuasa
 melawan gejolak di dalam dada
      Yang membara menahan rasa
    pertemuan kita nanti
   Saat kau ada di sisiku
  
 [Chorus]
 Semua kata rindumu semakin membuatku
 Tak berdaya menahan rasa ingin jumpa
 Percayalah padaku akupun rindu kamu
 Ku akan pulang melepas semua kerinduan
 Yang terpendam

 Kau tuliskan padaku
   Kata cinta yang manis dalam suratmu
 Kau katakan padaku
   Saat ini ku ingin hangat pelukmu
     Dan belai lembut kasihmu
    Takkan ku lupa slamanya
   Saat kau ada di sisiku
  
 Jangan katakan cinta menambah beban rasa
       Sudah simpan saja sedihmu itu
    Ku akan datang

 Tuning: Double Drop D (DADGBd)
  
 Tune e to d
  
 I’m pretty tired of dropping down to BDDDDD to play this song, so I thought I’d tab it
 in an easier to get to tuning… with no popping strings (and if you DO pop one… that’s
 sad).

 [Verse 1]
  
 You, with your words like knives and swords
 And weapons that you use against me 
 You, have knocked me off my feet again
 Got me feelin' like a nothin'
 You, with your voice like nails on a chalk board
 Callin' me out when I'm wounded
 You, pickin' on the weaker man
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus 1]
  
  Well you can take me down with just one single blow
      But you don't know, what you don't know...
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Someday I'll be livin' in a big ol' city 
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean
                     Why you gotta be so mean?
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 You, with your switching sides and
       Your wild fire lies and your humiliation
 You, have pointed out my flaws again
        -stop
 As if I don't already see them
 I walk with my head down
            Tryin' to block you out 
           'Cause I never impress you
 I just wanna feel okay again
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus 2]
  
 I bet you got pushed around
 Somebody made you cold
 But the cycle ends right now 'cause
 You can't lead me down that road
                     And you don't know what you don't know
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Someday I'll be livin' in a big ol' city 
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean
                     Why you gotta be so mean?
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
            And I can see you years from now in a bar
  Talkin' over a football game
 With that same big loud opinion
 But nobody's listening
 Washed up and ranting about the 
 Same old   bitter   things
 Drunk and grumblin' all about how I  can't sing
  no chord          But all you are is mean
  
 [Interlude]
  
 All you are is mean...and a liar...and pathetic
      And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
  
  
 *Palm mute first 2 lines*
      But someday I'll be livin' in a big ol' city 
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean,  yeah--ah

 Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Why you gotta be so...Someday
 I'll be livin in a big ol' city why ya gotta be so mean
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean why ya gotta be so mean
 Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me why ya gotta be so mean
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean

 [Verse 1]
            You get a shiver in the dark, it's raining in the park but meantime
   South of the river you stop and you hold everything
   A band is blowing Dixie double four time
    You feel alright when you hear that music ring
  
 [Verse 2]
                Well now, you step inside but you don't see too many faces
    Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
   Competition in other places
    Uh, but the horns they blowin' that sound
         way on down south
         way on down south

 [Verse 3]
               You check out Guitar George,     he knows all the chords
   Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
   They say an old guitar is all he can afford
    When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
  
 [Verse 4]
    And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
   He's got a daytime job, he's doin' alright
   He can play the honky tonk like anything
    Saving it up for Friday night
                    with the Sultans

         Then a crowd of young boys, they're foolin' around in the corner
    Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
   They don't give a damn about about any trumpet playin' band
    It ain't what they call rock and roll
                  and the Sultans
                               Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole

 [Verse 1]
  
 Now and then I think of when we were together
 Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
 Told myself that you were right for me
 But felt so lonely in your company
 But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
 Like resignation to the end
 Always the end
 So when we found that we could not make sense
 Well you said that we would still be friends
 But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 But you didn't have to cut me off
 Make out like it never happened
           And that we were nothing
      And I don't even need your love
           But you treat me like a stranger
            And that feels so rough
  
 You didn't have to stoop so low
 Have your friends collect your records
            And then change your number
    I guess that I don't need that though
 Now you're just somebody that I used to know

 Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
 But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
 And I don't wanna live that way
 Reading into every word you say
 You said that you could let it go
 And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 But you didn't have to cut me off
 Make out like it never happened

 [Verse 1]
 I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told
         I have squandered my resistance
        For a pocketful of mumbles such are promises
               All lies and jest still a man hears what he wants to hear
                     And disregards the rest
  
         When I left my home and family I was no more than a boy
         In the company of strangers
         In the quiet of a railway station running scared
         Laying low seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go
          Looking for the places only they would know

 [Verse 1]
  
 You can be the peanut butter to my jelly,
 You can be the butterflies I feel in my belly
 You can be the captain and I can be a first mate
 You can be the chills that I feel on our first date.
  
 You can be the hero and I can be a sidekick
 You can be the tear that I cry if we ever split
 You can be the rain from the cloud when it's stormin'
 Or you could be the sun when it shines in the mornin'

 Don't know if I could ever be
 Without you coz boy you complete me
 And in time I know that we'll both see
 That we're all we need

 You can be the prince and I can be your princess
 You can be the sweet tooth, I can be the dentist
 You can be the shoes and I can be the laces
 You can be heart that I spill on the pages.
  
 You can be the vodka and I can be the chaser,
 You can be the pencil and I can be paper
 You can be as cold as the winter  weather
 But I don't care as long as we're together

 She's all layed up in bed with a broken heart
 While i'm drinking Jack all alone in my local bar, and we don't know how
 How we got into this mad situation, only doing things out of frustration
 Trying to make it work, but man these times are hard
  
 She needs me now but I can’t seem to find the time
 I got a new job now on the unemployment line, and we don't know how
 How we got into this mess is it God's test?, Someone help us ‘cos we’re doing our best
 Trying to make it work but man these times are hard

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse]
   Hey there Delilah,
            What’s it like in New York City? 
        I’m a thousand miles away, 
             But girl tonight you look so pretty, 
          Yes you do, 
   Time Square can’t shine as bright as you, 
               I swear it’s true. 
   Hey there Delilah, 
            Don’t you worry about the distance, 
            I’m right there if you get lonely, 
            Give this song another listen, 
             Close your eyes, 
   Listen to my voice it’s my disguise, 
              I’m by your side. 
  
 [Chorus]
 Oh it’s what you do to me, 
 Oh it’s what you do to me, 
 Oh it’s what you do to me, 
 Oh it’s what you do to me, 
                 What you do to me.
  
 [Verse]
   Hey there Delilah,
         I know times are getting hard, 
             But just believe me girl some day, 
               I'll pay the bills with this guitar, 
                We'll have it good, 
   We'll have the life we knew we would, 
             My word is good.
  
   Hey there Delilah, 
           I’ve got so much left to say, 
           If every simple song I wrote to you, 
        Would take your breath away, 
               I’d write it all, 
   Even more in love with me you’d fall, 
               We’d have it all.
  
 [Chorus]
 Oh it’s what you do to me, 
 Oh it’s what you do to me, 
 Oh it’s what you do to me, 
 Oh it’s what you do to me, 
  
 [Bridge]
    A thousand miles seems pretty far, 
      But they’ve got planes and trains and cars, 
      I’d walk to you if I had no other way, 
      Our friends would all make fun of us, 
      And we'll just laugh along because, 
     We know that none of them have felt this way, 
    Delilah I can promise you, 
       That by the time that we get through, 
      The world will never ever be the same,
                And you’re to blame.
  
 [Verse]
   Hey there Delilah you be good, And don’t you miss me, 
           Two more years and you’ll be done with school, 
      And I'll be making history, 
         Like I do, 
   You’ll know it's all because of you, 
   We can do whatever we want to,
   Hey there Delilah here's to you, 
                 This one’s for you.
  
 [Chorus]
 Oh it’s what you do to me,
 Oh it’s what you do to me,
 Oh it’s what you do to me,
 Oh it’s what you do to me,

  Then I pray don't take me soon, 'cause I am here for reason
  
  
 [Pre-chorus]
  
 Sometimes in my tears I drown, but I never let it get me down
          So when negativity surrounds, I know someday it'll all turn around because

   Do you know what's worth fighting for
   When it's not worth dying for?
   Does it take you breath away
          And you feel yourself suffocating?
   Does the pain weight out the pride?
   And you look for a place to hide?
   Does someone break your heart inside?
            You're in ruins

   And the hangover doesn't pass
   Nothing's ever built to last
            You're in ruins

             It's gonna feel real good, gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
       As I, turn up the collar on  my favorite winter coat, this wind is blowin' my mind
            I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
            Who am I, to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
  
  A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
  And a one man's soul
       They follow each other on the wind ya' know
              'Cause they got nowhere to go
                                That's why I want you to know

              Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?
  
  A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
  And a washed-out dream
       They follow the pattern of the wind, ya' see
              'Cause they got no place to be
                                 That's why I'm starting with me

 Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us
      No nothing can come between
 You and I
      Oh, You and I
  
 [Verse 2]
   I figured it out
   Saw the mistakes of up and down
   Meet in the middle
   There's always room for common ground
   I see what it's like
   I see what it's like for day and night
   Never together
  'Cause they see things in a different light like us
           But they never tried like us
  
 [Chorus]
 You and I
 We don't wanna be like them
 We can make it till the end
 Nothing can come between 
 You and I
 Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Chorus]
                   'Cause You and I-------
 We don't wanna be like them
 We can make it till the end
 Nothing can come between
 You and I
 Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us
      No nothing can come between
 You and I,  You and I-------
       Oooh you and I
          Oooooh, You and I
                        We can make it if we try, You and I

 CAPO 2ND FRET
  
 [Verse 1]
 Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
 The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
 It’s hard
 Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
       It’s funny how things never change in this old town
     So far from the stars
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
   And I want to tell you everything
                    The words I never got to say the first time around
   And I remember everything
                        From when we were the children playing in this fairground
                            Wish I was there with you now
  
 [Chorus]
         If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
        Drive highways and byways to be there with you
 Over and over the only truth
 Everything comes back to you
 Mmm-mm-mm
  
 [Verse 2]
    I saw that you moved on with someone new
         In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
       It’s so hard
     So hard
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
   And I want to tell you everything
                    The words I never got to say the first time around
   And I remember everything
                        From when we were the children playing in this fairground

        Drive highways and byways to be there with you
 Over and over the only truth
 Everything comes back to you
      You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
       Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
 Over and over the only truth
 Everything comes back to you
 Mmm-mm-mm
  
 [Bridge]
   And I know that it’s wrong
                    That I can’t move on
                              But there’s something about you

 This is the greatest and best song in the world...   Tribute.
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,
 We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.
 All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon...
 In the middle of the road.
 And he said:
  
  
 (strum palm muted)
  
 ""Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your souls.""
  
  
 (back to normal picking)
  
 Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,
 And we each said...   ""Okay""
  
 And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
 Just so happened to be,
 The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
  
 Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
          One and one make two, two and one make three,
          It was destiny.
 Once every hundred-thousand years or so,
           When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
           And the grass don't grow...
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Needless to say, the beast was stunned.
 Whip-crack went his schwumpy tail,
 And the beast was done.
 He asked us: ""Be you angels?""
 And we said, ""Nay. We are but men!"" ROCK!
  
  
 [Interlude]
  
 Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,
 Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
  
 This is not The Greatest Song in the World.
 No, this is just a tribute.
 Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World.
 No, this is a tribute, oh.
  
    To The Greatest Song in the World, All right!
    It was The Greatest Song in the World, All right!
 It was the best muthafuckin' song
 The greatest song in the world.

 And the peculiar thing is this my friends:
 The song we sang on that fateful night,
 It didn't actually sound anything like this song.

                 This is just a tribute! You gotta' believe me!
                      And I wish you were there! Just a matter of opinion.

       On a white veil occasion

 I sneak in and see your friends 
          And her snotty little family 
      All dressed in pastel 
      And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
            Somewhere back inside a room 
            Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
  
 Thi--is i---is surely not

 I hear the preacher say speak now 
             Or forever hold your pe---ace
 There's a silence, there's my last chance 
 I stand up with shaky hands 
      All eyes on me
 Horrified looks from everyone in the room
      But I'm only lookin' at you

                Don't wait or say a single vow 
 You need to hear me out
       They said ""Speak Now""
                     And you say ""Let's run away now""
       I'll meet you when I'm out

 [Verse 1]
 I can't stand to fly
 I'm not that naive
 I'm just out to find
      The better part of me
  
 [Chorus]
                      I'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane
                    I'm more than some  pretty face beside a train

  Fall upon my knees
 Find a way to lie

 And the days feel like years

 You know the door to my very soul
              You're the light in my deepest darkest hour
             You're my saviour when I fall
          And you may not think I care for you
           When you know down inside that I really do
          And it's me you need to show,

 [Verse]
  
 I look at her and have to smile
 As we go driving for a while
 Her hair blowing in the open window of my car
 And as we go I see the lights
 Watch them glimmer in her eyes
 In the darkness of the evening
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And I've got all that I need
 Right here in the passenger seat
 Oh and I can't keep my eyes on the road
 Knowing that she's inches from me
 We stop to get something to drink
 My mind pounds and I can't think
 Scared to death to say I love her
 Then a moon peeks from the clouds
 Hear my heart that beats so loud
 Try to tell her simply
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
  
 That I've got all the I need
 Right here in the passenger seat
 Oh and I can't keep my eyes on the road

 Oh and I can't keep my eyes on the road
 Knowing that she's inches from me

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
 You got a fast car.
 I want a ticket to anywhere.
 Maybe we make a deal,
 Maybe together we can get somewhere.
 Any place is better.
 Starting from zero, got nothing to lose.
 Maybe we'll make something,
 Me myself, I got nothing to prove.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Verse 2]
 You got a fast car
 I got a plan to get us out of here:
 I been working at the convenience store,
 Managed to save just a little bit of money.
 Wont't have to drive too far
 Just across the border and into the city,
 You and I can both get jobs
 And finally see what it means to be living.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Verse 3]
 You see my old man's got a problem:
 He live with the bottle, that's the way it is.
 He says his body's too old for working,
 His body's too young to look like his.
 My mama went off and left him,
 she wanted more from life than he could give,
 I said, ""Somebody's got to take care of him.""
 So I quit school and that's what I did.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Verse 4]
 You got a fast car
 But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
 We gotta make a decision:
 Leave tonight or live and die this way.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Chorus]
  I remember when we were driving, driving in your car,
       The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,
   City lights lay out before us
            And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder.
      And I_____ had a feeling that I belonged
      And I_____ had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Verse 5]
 You got a fast car
   And we go cruising to entertain ourelves;
 You still ain't got a job
   And I work in a market as a checkout girl.
 I know things will get better:
   You'll find work and I'll get promoted,
 We'll move out of the shelter
   Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Chorus]
  I remember when we were driving, driving in your car,
       The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,
   City lights lay out before us
            And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder.
      And I_____ had a feeling that I belonged
      And I_____ had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Verse 6]
 You got a fast car
 And I got a job that pays all our bills.
 You stay out drinking late at the bar,
 See more your friends than you do your kids.
 I'd always hoped for better,
 Thought maybe together you and me would find it,
 I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere,
 so take your fast car and keep on driving.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Chorus]
  I remember when we were driving, driving in your car,
       The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,

 [Chorus]
  
 You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
 Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
 How to love
 How to love
  
 You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
 Now you in the corner tryna put it together
 How to love
 How to love
  
 For a second you were here
  
 Why you over there?
                   Its hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
                        Like you never had a love
                Never had a love

 When you was just a young’un your looks but so precious
 But now your grown up
                                 So fly its like a blessing but you can’t have a man look at you for 5 seconds
 Without you being insecure
 You never credit yourself so when you got older
        It’s seems like you came back 10 times over
 Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
 Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
 Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
 How to love

 [Verse 2]
  
 You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
                                   The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
         But it wasn’t your fault
  
 Wasn’t in your intentions
                To be the one here talking to me
  
 Be the one listening
 But I admire your poppin bottles and dippin’
 Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
 Baby, so don’t be mad
  
 Nobody else trippin
 You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 See You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
 Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out

 Now you in the corner tryna put it together

 Oooh,

                        Now we're under the covers
         Fast forward to eighteen
           We are more than lovers
         Yeah, we are all we need
           When we're holding each other
              I'm taken back to 2002
  
 Yeah
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
    Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods

    Songs with all our childhood friends
  
 And it went like this, say
  
  
 [Chorus]
   Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
           Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
          Better hit me, baby, one more time
    Paint a picture for you and me
           Of the days when we were young
    Singing at the top of both our lungs
                          On the day we fell in love

 [Verse]
  
                      Lovin' him is like, drivin' a new Maserati
                  Down a dead end street
 Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
           Ended so suddenly
                      Loving him is like, tryin' to change your mind 
              Once you're already flying through the free fall
           Like the colors in autumn so bright
                   Just before they lose it all
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                 Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
                  Missing him was dark grey, all alone
                     Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
            You never met
                     But loving him was red
            Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed
                 Lovin' him was red
            Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed
  
  
 [Verse]
  
                         Touching him was like, realizing all you ever wanted 
                     Was right there in front of you
                         Memorizing him was as, easy as knowin' all the words
                      To your old favorite song
                             Fighting with him was like tryin' to solve a 
                Crossword and realizing there's no right answer
                          Regretting him was like wishing you never found out 
                         That love could be that strong 
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                 Losing him was blue, like I'd never known

            You never met
                     But loving him was red

                           Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echos

       But moving on from him is impossible 
       When I still see it all in my, head 
              And burning red
         Burning was reeeeed
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                    Oh losing him was blue, like I'd never known
                  Missing him was dark grey, all alone
                     Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody

 [Verse]
  
 Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
           When I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
 Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
       And rode us all the way into New Orleans
  
    I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
      I's playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues
 Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
 We sang every song that driver knew
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
 Nothin', it ain't nothin' honey, if it ain't free
      And feelin' good was easy, lord, oh, when he sang the blues
           You know feelin' good was good enough for me
 Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

           From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
       Yeah Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
          Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
       Yeah Bobby baby kept me from the cold
  
      One day up near Salinas, lo-ord, I let him slip away
       He's lookin' for that home and I hope he finds it
           Well I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday
        To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
 Nothin', and that's all that Bobby left me
        Well, feelin' good was easy, lo-o-ord, when he sang the blues

   Pare ko, meron akong prublema
   'Wag mo sabihing ""na naman?""
   In-lab ako sa isang kolehiyala
   Hindi ko maintindihan
   Wag na nating idaan sa ""maboteng"" usapan
   Lalu lang madaragdagan ang sakit ng ulo at bilbil sa tiyan.

   Anong sarap, kami'y naging magkaibigan
   Napuno ako ng pag-asa
   Yun pala hanggang dun lang ang kaya
   Akala ko ay puwede pa
   Masakit mang isipin, kailangang tanggapin
           Kung kelan ka naging siryoso, saka ka niya gagaguhin.

           And if a ten ton truck
 kills the both of us
   to die by your side
      the pleasure the privilege is mine
  
 [Verse 3]
    Take me out    tonight
             oh take me anywhere, I don't care
          I don't care
             And in the darkened underpass
    I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last
  
              (but then a strange fear gripped me and I
 just couldn't ask)
  
 [Verse 4]
     Take me out   tonight
          take me anywhere, I don't care
          I don't care
       Just driving in your car
    I never never want to go home
    because I haven't got one
            I haven't got one
  
 [Bridge]
  
 [Chorus]
           And if a double-decker bus
 crashes into us
   to die by your side
            is such a heavenly way to die
           And if a ten ton truck
 kills the both of us
   to die by your side
      the pleasure the privilege is mine

0,All Of The Stars chords,All Of The Stars – Ed Sheeran,"[Verse 1]
 It's just another night, and I'm staring at the Moon,
 I saw a shooting star and thought of you.
 I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew, 
 If you were here I'd sing to you.
 You're on the other side as the skyline splits in two,
 Miles away from seeing you.
 But I can see the stars from Amer - i - ca
 I wonder do you see them too.
  
 [Chorus]
                So open your eyes and see,
                 The way our horizons meet.
                  And all of the lights will lead,
            Into the night with me.
                    And I know these scars will bleed,
                   But both of our hearts believe,
                All of these stars will guide us home.
  
 [Verse 2]
 I can hear your heart on the ra - di - o    beats,
 They're playing 'Chasing Cars' and I thought of us.
 Back to the time you were lying next to me,
 I looked across and fell in love.
 So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets I knew,
 Everything led back to you.
 So can you see the stars over Am - ster - dam?
 Hear the song my heart is beating to.
  
 [Chorus]
                So open your eyes and see,
                 The way our horizons meet.

            Into the night with me.

       I met you in the dark You lit me up 
        You made me feel as though I was enough
       We danced the night away We drank too much 
   I held your hair back when You were throwing up
  
  Then you smiled over your shoulder For a minute, I was stone cold sober
    I pulled you closer to my chest 
   And you asked me to stay over I said, I already told ya
   I think that you should get some rest
  
  I knew I loved you then But you'd never know
   Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
   I know I needed you But I never showed
    But I wanna stay with you Until we're grey and old
       Just say you won't let go Just say you won't let go
  
   I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
    I'll bring you coffee with A kiss on your head
  And I'll take the kids to school Wave them goodbye
   And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night
  
  When you looked over your shoulder For a minute, I forget that I'm older
    I wanna dance with you right now, oh
       And you look as beautiful as ever And I swear that everyday you'll get better
   You make me feel this way somehow
  
  I'm so in love with you And I hope you know
   Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
   We've come so far my dear Look how we've grown
   And I wanna stay with you Until we're grey and old
       Just say you won't let go Just say you won't let go
  
   I wanna live with you Even when we're ghosts
   Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most
  
   I'm gonna love you till My lungs give out
   I promise till death we part Like in our vows
   So I wrote this song for you Now everybody knows
   Cause it's just you and me Until we're grey and old

 In Taylor's acoustic version she plays her G as
 Gsus2 [300033], and the Cadd9 as Csus2 [x30033].
 I'm NOT changing the chord names throughout because
 playing what I have sounds the same, whether
 playing along with her live version or the CD
 track.  Link to her live acoustic version -

 Capo II
  
  
 Every night in my dreams, 
    I see you, I feel you
 That is how I know you go on.
  
 Far across the distance
      and spaces between us
 you have come to show you go on.
  
 Near, far, wherever you are
      I believe that the heart does go on.
  
 Once more you open the door
             and you're here in my heart
         and my heart will go on and on.
  
  
 Love can touch us one time
      and last for a life time
 and never let go till we're gone.
 Love was when I loved you
      one true time I hold to
 in my life we'll always go on.
  
 Near, far, wherever you are
      I believe that the heart does go on.
  
 Once more you open the door
             and you're here in my heart
         and my heart will go on and on.
  
  
 You're here, there's nothing I fear
        and I know that my heart will go on.
 We'll stay forever this way
          you are safe in my heart
         and my heart will go on and on.

             And you're here in my heart
         And my heart will go on and on
  
 You're here, there's nothing I fear,
        And I know that my heart will go on
 We'll stay forever this way
          You are safe in my heart
         And my heart will go on and on

 My Heart Will Go On v.3 chords
 Celine Dion
  
  
 Every night in my dreams, 
    I see you, I feel you
 That is how I know you go on.
  
 Far across the distance
      and spaces between us
 you have come to show you go on.
  
 Near, far, wherever you are
      I believe that the heart does go on.
  
 Once more you open the door
             and you're here in my heart
         and my heart will go on and on.
  
  
 Love can touch us one time
      and last for a life time
 and never let go till we're one.
 Love was when I loved you
  
      one true time I hold to
 in my life we'll always go on.
  
  
 You're here, there's nothing I fear
        and I know that my heart will go on.
 We'll stay forever this way
          you are safe in my heart
         and my heart will go on and on.

 [Verse 1]
 I know a girl
                She puts the color inside of my world
 She's just like a maze
                     Where all of the walls all continually change
 I've done all I can
                    To stand on the steps with my heart in my hands
   Now I started to see
                   Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

   Fathers be good to your daughters
   Daughters will love like you do
 Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
      So mothers be good to your daughters too

 Oh, you see that skin
            It's the same she's been standing in
            Since the day she saw him walkin' away
             Now she's left cleaning up the mess he made

   Boys you can break
 Find out how much they can take
                Boys will be strong and
               Boys soldier on
                     But boys would be gone
                     Without warmth of a woman's good good heart

 [Verse 1]
  
 We were both young when I first saw you
    I close my eyes and the flashback starts
               I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
  
 See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
 See you make your way through the crowd
             And say hello
             Little did I know
  
  
       That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
         And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
            And I was crying on the staircase
 Begging you please don't go, and I said
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
 I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
 You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
 It's a love story, baby just say yes
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
     So I sneak out to the garden to see you
 We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
                So close your eyes
                         Escape this town for a little while oh
        Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
  
  
         And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
               But you were everything to me
        I was begging you please don't go, and I said
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
 I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
 You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
 It's a love story baby just say yes
  
 Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
 This love is difficult, but it's real
 Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
 It's a love story baby just say yes, oh - oh -oh
  
  
 [Interlude]
  
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
                 I got tired of waiting,   wondering if you were ever coming around
                     My faith in you was fading
         When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
 I keep waiting for you but you never come
     Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
     He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
  
  
 Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
 I love you and that's all I really know
    I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
 It's a love story baby just say yes
     Oh-ooh, oh-oh, oh
        Cause we were both young when I first saw you
