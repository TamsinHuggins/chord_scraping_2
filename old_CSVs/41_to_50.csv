 [Verse 1]
  Never made it as a wise man
   I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'
  Tired livin' like a blind man
   I'm sick inside without a sense of feelin'
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 And this is how you remind me
  This is how you remind me of what I really am
  This is how you remind me of what I really am
  
  
 [Chorus]
  It's not like you   to say sorry
  Always waitin' on a different story
  This time I'm   mistaken
   For handin' you a heart worth breaking
 And I've been wrong   I've been down
  To the bottom of every bottle
   These five words in my head  scream ""Are we havin' fun yet?""

  It's not like you didn't know that
  I said I love you and I swear I still do
  And it must have been so bad
  Cause livin with me must have damn near killed you
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  This is how you remind me of what I really am
  This is how you remind me of what I really am

 certain way. Well, the truth is you don't. You can play the song in regular tuning.
 The chords you need are...
 The E chord, the B chord, and the A. With the E chord you have to do a little
 hammer on. The G string is hammered on the 2nd fret. If you listen to the song you

         then I watch them roll away   again, yeah

 Headed for the Frisco bay
 'Cause I've had nothing to live for
      and look like nothing's gonna come my way

 [Bridge]
  
   Look like nothing's gonna change
        Everything still remains the same
      I can't do what ten people tell me to do
    So I guess I'll remain the same
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Sittin' here resting my bones
 and this loneliness won't leave me alone
 These 2000 miles I roamed
          just to make this dock my home
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
      I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
               watching the tide roll away

 there is bitter in everyday

 the sweetest love can be so hard to find

 [Verse 1]
  
 Take me now, baby, here as I am.
 Pull me close try and understand.
 Desire is hunger, is the fire I breathe.
 Love is a banquet on which we feed.
  
 Come on now, try and understand
      the way I feel when I'm in your hand.
 Take my hand; come under cover.
       They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Because the night belongs to lovers.
 Because the night belongs to lust.
 Because the night belongs to lovers.
 Because the night belongs to us.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Have I doubt when I'm alone?
 Love is a ring on the telephone.
 Love is an angel disguised as lust,
 here in our bed until the morning comes.
  
 Come on now, try and understand
      the way I feel under your command.
 Take my hand as the sun descends.
       They can't touch you now, can't touch you now, can't touch you now.

 Because the night belongs to lust.

 Without you I cannot live, forgive the yearning burning.
      I believe it's time, too real to feel.
     So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Because the night belongs to lovers.
 Because the night belongs to lust.
 Because the night belongs to lovers.
 Because the night belongs to us.
  
 Because tonight there are two lovers.
 If we believe in the night we trust
 Because the night belongs to lovers.
 Because the night belongs to us.

 Cocaine flame in my bloodstream
 Sold my coat when I hit Spokane
 Bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes
         in the early morning rain
  
   Lately my hands they don't feel like mine
 My eyes been stung with dust and blind
 Held you in my arms one time
 Lost you just the same

 Booze in my hair and blood on my lips
    A picture of you holding a picture of me

 Still don't know what love means

 Been so long since I seen your face
     Or felt a part of this human race
            I've been living out of this here suitcase

 A man needs something he can hold onto
    A nine pound hammer or a woman like you
 Either one of them things will do

 [Verse]
  
 Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
 But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
     My daddy told me ""Son, don't you get involved in
 Politics, religions or other people's quarrels""
  
  
 [Prechorus]
  
    I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
        I know when I have children they will know what it means
        And I pass on these things my family's given to me
       Just love and understanding, positivity
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
           We could change this whole world with a piano
     Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
   I'm just a boy with a one-man show
 No university, no degree But Lord knows 
   everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
     And the stock market's crashing in their portfolios
        While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
     Sing, love could change the world in a moment
     But what do I know? 
    Love can change the world in a moment
     But what do I know?
    Love can change the world in a moment

        Just remember life is more than fitting in your jeans
       It's love and understanding, positivity
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
           We could change this whole world with a piano
     Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
   I'm just a boy with a one-man show
 No university, no degree But Lord knows 
   everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
     And the stock market's crashing in their portfolios
        While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
     Sing, love could change the world in a moment
     But what do I know? 
    Love can change the world in a moment
     But what do I know?
    Love can change the world in a moment
  
  
 [Prechorus]
  
    I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
        You know the futures in the hands of you and me 
        So lets all get together we can all be free
       Spread love and understanding, positivity
  
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
           We could change this whole world with a piano
     Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
   I'm just a boy with a one-man show
 No university, no degree But Lord knows 
   everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
     And the stock market's crashing in their portfolios
        While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
     Sing, love could change the world in a moment
     But what do I know? 
    Love can change the world in a moment
     But what do I know?
    Love can change the world in a moment

 [Verse 1]
 If I could reach the stars, pull one down for you
 Shinin' on my heart, so you could see the truth
 Then this love I have inside, is everything it seems
 But for now I find, its only in my dreams
  
 [Chorus]
            And I can change  the world.  I would be the sunlight in your universe
 You would think our love was really some-thing good
       Baby if I could, change......        the world
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Verse 2]
 If I could be king,  even for a day
 I'd take you as my queen.  I'd have it no other way
    And our love would rule, this kingdom we have made
 Till then I'd be a fool, wishin for the day...
  
 [Chorus]
            And I can change the world.  I would be the sunlight in your universe
 You would think our love was really some-thing good
       Baby if I could, change           the world
       Baby if I could, change.............  the world
  
 [Break]

 got this song this morning and decided to figure it out, not too hard.
 email/comment for corrections, and ratings are appreciated :)
  
 PS. I haven't quite figured out the intro, so if anyone knows, it'd be
 appreciated, and you'd be credited for it.

 [Verse]
  
             I feel the salty waves come in
              I feel them crash against my skin
        And I smile as I respire because I know they'll never win
            There's a haze above my TV
               That changes everything I see
               And maybe if I continue watching
                I'll lose the traits that worry me
  
 Cm  (hold)
 Can we fast-forward to go down on me?
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
        Stop there and let me correct it
     I wanna live a life from a new perspective
   You come along because I love your face
 And I'll admire your expensive taste
 And who cares divine intervention
      I wanna be praised from a new perspective
 But leaving now would be a good idea
 So catch me up on getting out of here
  
  
 [Verse]
  
         Taking everything for granted but we still respect the time
          We move along with some new passion knowing everything is fine
              And I would wait and watch the hours fall in a hundred separate lines
          But I regain repose and wonder how I ended up inside
  
 Cm  (hold)
 Can we fast-forward until you go down on me?
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
        Stop there and let me correct it
     I wanna live a life from a new perspective
   You come along because I love your face
 And I'll admire your expensive taste
 And who cares divine intervention
      I wanna be praised from a new perspective
 But leaving now would be a good idea
 So catch me up on getting out of here
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
    More to the point, I need to show
    How much I can come and go
    Other plans fell through
   And put a heavy load on you
   I know there's no more that need be said
                                When I'm inching through your bed
                     Take a look around instead and watch me go
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
        Stop there and let me correct it
     I wanna live a life from a new perspective
   You come along because I love your face
 And I'll admire your expensive taste
 And who cares divine intervention
      I wanna be praised from a new perspective
 But leaving now would be a good idea
 So catch me up on getting out of here

 Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
 Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
 Doo-doo-doo
  
  
 [Verse 1]
                     I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling,
        She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
  
 She says she lives for me
 Ovation her own motivation
 She comes around and she goes down on me
                  And I make her smile like a drug for you
 Do ever what you want to do
              Coming over you
             Keep on smiling what we go through
 One stop to the rhythm that divides you
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
                                       Chop another line like a coda with a curse
                 Come on like a freak show takes the stage
  
 We give them the games we play she said
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
 I want something else
                         To get me through this
 Semi-charmed kind of life baby, baby
 I want something else, I'm not listening
           when you say good~~~bye
  
  
 [Post-chorus]
 Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
 Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
 Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

 [Verse 2]
                 The sky it was gold, it was rose
        I was taking sips of it through my nose
  
 And I wish I could get back there
             Some place back there
                 Smiling in the pictures you would take
 Doing crystal meth will lift
  
 you up until you break
            It won't stop I won't come down
         I keep stock with a tick-tock
  
 rhythm, a bump for the drop
             And then I bumped up
             I took the hit that I was given
         Then I bumped again
 N.C.
 Then I bumped again, said
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
   How do I get back there to
        The place where I
          fell asleep inside you?
   How do I get myself back to
        The place where you said
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
 I want something else
                         To get me through this
 Semi-charmed kind of life baby, baby
 I want something else, I'm not listening
           when you say Good~~~bye
  
  
 [Verse 3]
 I believe in the sand
             beneath my toes
 N.C.
 The beach gives a feeling
            An earthy feeling
      I believe in the
             faith that grows
 N.C.
 And the four right
             chords can make me cry
 When I'm with you I
                    feel like I could die
 N.C.
 And that would be
 all right,   all right
  
  
 [Bridge]
                 and when the plane came in
       She said she was crashing
                 The velvet it rips in
                the city we tripped
                  On the urge to feel alive
       But now I'm struggling
  
 to survive
         Those days you were wearing
        That velvet dress
   You're the priestess
     I must confess
        Those little red panties
        They pass the test
       G (hold)
 Slide up around the belly face down on the mattress
 One...
 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""D"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">D</span> And you hold me, and we're broken.
              Still it's all that I wanna do, just a little now!
  
  
 [Verse 4]
 Feel myself head
        made of the ground
 N.C.
 I'm scared I'm not coming
 down, no     no, and I won't
          run for my life
 She's got her jaws now
                    locked down in a smile
                 But nothing is alright,   alright
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
 I want something else
            To get me through this
  life, baby
 I want something else
  
 I'm not listening
 when you say goodbye
      goodbye
      goodbye
      goodbye

                 The sky it was gold it was rose

 N.C.
 And I wish I could get back there
             Some place back there
         in the place you used to start
 Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
 Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

 [Verse]
            Your fingertips across my skin 
                 The palm trees swaying in the wind 
     Images 
              You sang me Spanish lullabies
               The sweetest sadness in your eyes
         Clever trick 
          Well, I never want to see you unhappy
    I thought you'd want the same for me 
  
 [Chorus]
  Goodbye, my almost lover 
  Goodbye, my hopeless dream 
  I'm trying not to think about you 
  Can't you just let me be? 
  So long, my luckless romance
  My back is turned on you 
  Should've known you'd bring me heartache
  Almost lovers always do 
  
 [Verse]
   We walked along a crowded street 
              You took my hand and danced with me 
     Images 
               And when you left, you kissed my lips 
                        You told me you would never, never forget
           These images, no
            Well, I'd never want to see you unhappy 
    I thought you'd want the same for me 
  
 [Chorus]
  Goodbye, my almost lover 
  Goodbye, my hopeless dream 
  I'm trying not to think about you 
  Can't you just let me be? 
  So long, my luckless romance
  My back is turned on you 
  Should've known you'd bring me heartache
  Almost lovers always do

  I cannot go to the ocean

                             I cannot wake up in the morning 
                    Without you on my mind 
                                  Well so you're gone and I'm haunted 
                         And I bet you are just fine 
 Did I make it that 
 Easy to walk right in and out
        Of my life?

  Goodbye, my almost lover 
  Goodbye, my hopeless dream 
  I'm trying not to think about you 
  Can't you just let me be? 
  So long, my luckless romance
  My back is turned on you

  Almost lovers always do

 [Verso 1: Enrique Iglesias]
 Yo te miro, se me corta la respiración
 Cuando tu me miras se me sube el corazón
 (Me palpita lento el corazon)
 Y en silencio tu mirada dice mil palabras
 La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol
 (Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
                  Tu cuerpo y el mio llenando el vacío
                 Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando)
  
 [Coro 1: Alexander]
   (Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando)
                     Ese fuego por dentro me va enloqueciendo
               Me va saturando

                       La cerveza y el tequila y tu boca con la mía
               Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas) Ya no puedo mas (ya no puedo mas)
  
 [Coro 2: Alexander]
                Con esta melodía, tu color, tu fantasía
                Con tu filosofía mi cabeza esta vacía

 Tu me miras y me llevas a otra dimensión

 Tus latidos aceleran a mi corazón

 Que ironía del destino no poder tocarte
 Abrazarte
 y sentir la magia de tu olor

 [VERSE 1]
  
         Well I woke up to the sound of silence and guns
                                were cutting like knives in a fist fight
        And I found you with a bottle of wine
       your head in the curtains and heart like the 4th of July
  
                     You swore and said we are not
             we are not shining stars
         This i know
                cause i never said we are
  
              Though I've never been through hell like that
       I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back
  
  
 [CHORUS]
  
            If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin like a stone
        Carry on
           May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground
        Carry on

       So I met up with some friends at the edge of the night
                at a bar off 75
         And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
            All our neighbors and wives
  
  
 [PRE CHORUS]
  
          But i'd like to think
        I can cheat it all
          to make up for the times i've been cheated on
           And it's nice to know
             when i was left for dead
        I was found and I know not these streets
       I am not the ghost you want to be

     My head is on fire, but my legs they're fine
              Cause after all, they are mine

          show me how, no one's ever gonna stop us now

 [Verse 1]
                   You're just too good to be true
                Can't take my eyes off you
                 You feel like Heaven to touch
          I wanna hold you so much
               At long last love has arrived
               And I thank God I'm alive

               There are no words left to speak
              But if you feel like I feel
                 Please let me know that it's real

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 It's a little bit funny this feeling inside 
 I'm not one of those who can easily hide 
 I don't have much money but, boy if I did 
 I'd buy a big house where, we both could live 
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 If I was a sculptor, but then again, no 
 Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show 
 I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do 
 My gift is my song and, this one's for you 
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And you can tell everybody, this is your song 
 It may be quite simple but, now that it's done 
    I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind,
         that I put down in words 
      How wonderful life is, while you're in the world 
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 I sat on the roof and, kicked off the moss 
 Well a few of the verses well, they've got me quite cross
 But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song 
 It's for people like you, that keep it turned on 
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
       So excuse me forgetting but, these things I do 
      You see I've forgotten if they're, green or they're blue 
 Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean 
 Yours are the sweetest eyes, I've ever seen
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And you can tell everybody, this is your song 
 It may be quite simple but, now that it's done 
    I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind,
         that I put down in words 
      How wonderful life is, while you're in the world 
  
  
 [Outro]
  
    I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind,
         that I put down in words

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
 Car rides to Malibu, strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
              And trading jackets, laughin' 'bout how small it looks on you (ah-ha ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha)
 Watchin' reruns of Glee, bein' annoying singin' in harmony
              I bet she's braggin' to all her friends sayin' you're so unique (huh)
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus 1]
 N.C.               So when you gonna tell her that we did that too?
                  She thinks it's special, but it's all re-used
               That was our place, I found it first, I made the jokes you tell to her
                  When she's with you
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
                                     Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
                           Do you get déjà vu, hmm?    (hmm)
    N.C.                   Do you get déjà vu, huh?
  
  
 [Verse 2]
         Do you call her, almost say my name?
                  'Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
          Another actress, I hate to think that I was just your type
  
             I bet that she knows Billy Joel 'cause you played her Uptown Girl
         You're singin' it together, now I bet you even tell her
          How you love her in between the chorus and the verse (I love you)
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus 2]
 N.C.               So when you gonna tell her that we did that too?
                  She thinks it's special, but it's all re-used
                That was the show we talked about, played you the songs she's singin' now
                  When she's with you
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
                                     Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
                         Do you get déjà vu, oh   
    N.C.
 Do you get déjà vu?
  
  
 [Bridge]
 Strawberry ice cream in Malibu, don't act like we didn't do that shit too
 You're trading jackets like we used to do (yeah everything is all re-used)
 Play her piano but she doesn't know that I was the one who taught you Billy Joel
 A different girl now but there's nothing new (I know you get déjà vu)
  
  
 [Outro]
       I know you get déjà vu
       I know you get déjà vu

 [Verse]
 Been traveling these wide roads for so long
                  My heart’s been far from you
                         Ten-thousand miles gone                      
 Oh, I wanna come near and give ya
                   Every part of me
 But there's blood on my hands
                         And my lips are unclean
 In my darkness I remember
                             Momma’s words reoccur to me

 I go in
       As a man with many crimes
 Come up for air

 Oh, I wanna come near and give ya

 [Verse 1]
 Show me how to lie
                  you’re getting better all the time
               And turning all against the one
         is an art that’s hard to teach
 Another clever word
               sets off an unsuspecting herd
              and as you step back into line
          A mob jumps to their feet
  
       Now dance fucker dance
          man he never had a chance
          And no one even knew
          it was really only you
  
 [Pre-chorus]
               And now you steal away
            take him out today
        Nice work you did
                   you’re gonna go far, kid
  
 [Chorus]
          With a thousand lies and a good disguise
           Hit ‘em right between the eyes
           Hit ‘em right between the eyes
           when you walk away,nothing more to say
           See the lightning in your eyes
           See ‘em running for their lives
  
 [Verse 2]
 Slowly out of line
                and drifting closer in your sights

 I feel so unsure as I take your hand and lead you 
 To the dance floor; As the music dies
  Something in your eyes Calls to mind a silver screen
      And all it's sad goodbyes
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
  I'm never gonna dance again, Guilty feet have got no rhythm,
  Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
 Should have known better than to cheat a friend
      And waste the chance that I've been given
  So I'm never gonna dance again
      The way I danced with you.  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Time can never mend
      The careless whispers of a good friend
  To the heart and mind
  Ignorance is kind
 There’s no comfort in the truth
 Pain is all you'll find
  
 [Chorus]
  
  I'm never gonna dance again, Guilty feet have got no rhythm,
  Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
 Should have known better than to cheat a friend
      And waste the chance that I've been given
  So I'm never gonna dance again
      The way I danced with you.

 [Verse 3]
  
    Tonight the music seems so loud
    I wish that we could lose this crowd
 Maybe it's better this way
       We'd hurt each other with the things we'd wanna say
  
     We could have been so good together
     We could have lived this dance forever
      But now who's gonna dance with me?
  
 Please stay

  I'm never gonna dance again, Guilty feet have got no rhythm,

 Lazing on a sunny afternoon.

 All I've got this sunny afternoon.

 Sipping on my ice cold beer,
 Lazing on a sunny afternoon.

 Help me, help me, help me sail away,
                Well, give me two good reasons why I oughta stay.

 Live this life of luxury,

 Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze,

 This refers to the acoustic version off the We Dance EP. And this is
 as close as I can get it. I put the chords I use at the end, so scroll
 down. Mraz likes to mix it up, so the strumming, for instance, changes throughout
 the song. Have fun.

 When I look into your eyes
 It's like watching the night sky
 Or a beautiful sunrise
 So much they hold
 And just like them old stars
 I see that you've come so far
 To be right where you are
 How old is your soul?

                                                I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
           Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
                                                 The tools, the skills we've got yeah we got a lot at stake
  
              And in the end, you're still my friend at least we didn't tend
            For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
             We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
     I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
       And who I am
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
              I won't give up on us
               Even if the skies get rough
                 I'm giving you all my love
                    I'm still looking up
         still looking up
  
                 No I won't give up on us
                 God knows I've had enough
           We got a lot to learn
               God know we're worth it
  
              I won't give up on us
               Even if the skies get rough
                 I'm giving you all my love

          now she walks through her sunken dream
          To the seat with the clearest view
                                  and she's hooked to the silver screen
            But the film is a saddening bore

 [Verse]
  
  I woke up early this morning around 4am,
           With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate.
  I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep,
      But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake.
  Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms,
            I've been tryin' my best to get along.
  
 But that's OK,
  
 There's nothing left to say, but:
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
  Take your records, take your freedom,
                             Take your memories I don't need 'em.
                                Take your space and take your reasons,
  
 But you'll think of me.
  And take your cat and leave my sweater,
                                 'Cause we have nothing left to weather.
                                 In fact, I'll feel a whole lot better,
                          But you'll think of me, you'll think of me.
  
  
 [Verse]
  
  I went out driving trying to clear my head,
             I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left.
  I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this,
      And all the baggage that seems to still exist.
  It seems the only blessing I have left to my name,
         Is not knowing what we could of been,
  
 What we should've been, so:
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
  Take your records, take your freedom,
                             Take your memories I don't need 'em.
                                Take your space and take your reasons,
  
 But you'll think of me.
  And take your cat and leave my sweater,
                                 'Cause we have nothing left to weather.
                                 In fact, I'll feel a whole lot better,
                      But you'll think of me.

                           Wishing I could hold you tight.
  
 I'll be over you,
      And on with my life.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
  So take your records, take your freedom,
 Take your memories I don't need 'em.
  And take your cat and leave my sweater,
                                 'Cause we have nothing left to weather.

 [Verse 1]
 I am the passenger
 And I ride and I ride
 I ride through the city backside
 I see the stars come out of the sky
 Yeah, they're bright in a hollow sky
 You know it looks so good tonight
  
 [Instrumental]

 [Verse 2]
 I am the passenger
 I stay under glass
 I look through my window so bright
 I see the stars come out tonight
 I see the bright and hollow sky
 Over the city's ripped-back sky
 And everything looks good tonight

 [Verse 3]
 Get into the car
 We’ll be the passenger
 We’ll ride through the city tonight
 We’ll see the city's ripped backsides
 We’ll see the bright and hollow sky
 We’ll see the stars that shine so bright
 The stars made for us tonight
  
 [Instrumental]

 [Verse 4]
 Oh, the passenger
 How-how he rides
 Oh, the passenger
 He rides and he rides
 He looks through his window
 What does he see?
 He sees the silent hollow sky
 He sees the stars come out tonight
 He sees the city's ripped backsides
 He sees the winding ocean drive
 And everything was made for you and me
 All of it was made for you and me
 'Cause it just belongs to you and me
 So let’s take a ride and see what’s mine

 Oh, the passenger
 He rides and he rides
 He sees things from under glass
 He looks through his window inside
 He sees the things he knows are his
 He sees the bright and hollow sky
 He sees the city asleep at night
 He sees the stars are out tonight
 And all of it is yours and mine
 And all of it is yours and mine
 Oh, let's ride and ride and ride and ride
  
                Oh, singing

 [Verse 1]
  
                   It was Christmas Eve babe, in the drunktank
             An old man said to me, won't see another one
              And then he sang a song, The Rare Old Mountain Dew
              I turned my face away and dreamed about you
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
           Got on a lucky one, came in eighteen to one
             I've got a feeling this year's for me and you
           So happy Christmas, I love you baby
              I can see a better time when all our dreams come true

         Big as bars
              They've got rivers of gold
          But the wind goes right through you
                        It's no place for the old
           When you first took my hand
       On a cold Christmas Eve
      You promised me
               Broadway was waiting for me
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
           You were handsome
  
 You were pretty
                    Queen of New York City
           When the band finished playing
       They howled out for more
 Sinatra was swinging
                           All the drunks they were singing
     We kissed on the corner
       Then danced through the night

     Sunday morning rain is falling
 Steal some covers share some skin
 Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
       You twist to fit the mold that I am in
       But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
                And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
           That some day it would lead me back to you
           That some day it would lead me back to you
  
 [Chorus]
               That may be all I need In darkness she is all I see

                                  Driving slow on Sunday Morning and I never want to leave
  
 [Verse 2]
 Fingers trace your every outline Paint a picture with my hands
 Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm 
              Change of weather, still together when it ends 
  
  
 [Chorus]
               That may be all I need In darkness she is all I see

 There there used to be a greying tower alone on the sea
         You became the light on the dark side of me

                                 But did you know that when it snows,
       My eyes become large and the light that you shine can´t be seen....

 Baby I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
 Ooh, the more I get of you the stranger it feels
                     And now that your rose is in bloom
      A light hits the gloom on the grey

 There is so much a man can tell you so much he can say
 You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
 Baby to me you´re like a growing addiction that I can´t deny
                              Won´t you tell me is that healthy baby
               But did you know that when it snows,
      My eyes become large and the light that you shine can´t be seen
  
 [Chorus]
 Baby I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
 Ooh, the more I get of you the stranger it feels
                     And now that your rose is in bloom
      A light hits the gloom on the grey

 Standing next to me
  
 Only my enemy
       I'll crush him with everything I own
 say what you want to say
                                and hang for your hollow ways moving your mouth

 Your father made fetuses
  
 With flesh licking ladies
        While you and your mother
                             Were asleep in the trailer park
 Thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums
      The music and medicine you needed for comforting
 So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving
      And pluck all your silly strings
                                And bend all your notes for me
 Soft silly music is meaningful magical
      The movements were beautiful
                    All in your ovaries
 All of them milking with green fleshy flowers
        While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines
 Smelling of semen all under the garden
      Was all you were needing when you still believed in me
 Say what you wanna say and hang for your hollow ways
 Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracles aimed for me

 'See the number on the matchbook is old and faded
 She's living in L.A. with my best old ex-friend Ray
 A guy she said she knew well and sometimes hated
  
 [Chorus]
 Isn't that the way they say it goes
               But let's forget all that
      And give me the number if you can find it
     So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine and to show
 I've overcome the blow, I've learned to take it well
 I only wish my words could just convince myself
                         That it just wasn't real, but that's not the way it feels
  
 [Interlude]
  
 [Verse]
 Operator oh could you help me place this call
 Cause I can't read the number that you just gave me
 There's something in my eyes, you know it happens every time
 I think about the love that I thought would save me
  
 [Chorus]
 Isn't that the way they say it goes
              But lets forget all that
      And give me the number if you can find it
     So I can call just to tell 'em I'm fine and to show
 I've overcome the blow, I've learned to take it well
 I only wish my words could just convince myself
                         That it just wasn't real, but that's not the way it feels
   No no no no   That's not the way it feels
  
 [Verse]
 Operator let's forget about this call
 There's no one there I really wanted to talk to
 Thank you for your time,
 Cause you've been so much more than kind
 You can keep the dime
  
 [Chorus]
 Isn't that the way they say it goes
              But lets forget all that
      And give me the number if you can find it
     So I can call just to tell her I'm fine and to show
 I've overcome the blow, I've learned to take it well
 I only wish my words could just convince myself
                         That it just wasn't real, but that's not the way it feels

 [Intro]
  
 [Chorus 1]
 Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
 Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
 It takes a lot to change a man
          Hell, it takes a lot to try
 Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
  
 [Verse 1]
 Nobody knows what waits for the dead
 Nobody knows what waits for the dead
 Some folks just believe in the things they've heard and the things they read
 Nobody knows what awaits for the dead
  
 I'm glad I can't go back to where I came from
 I'm glad those days are gone, gone for good
 But If I could take spirits from my past and bring them here you know I would
      Know I would
  
 [Verse 2]
 Nobody speaks to God these days
 Nobody speaks to God these days
 I'd like to think he's lookin' down and laughin' at our ways
 Nobody speaks to God these days
  
 When I was a child they tried to fool me
 Said the worldly man was lost and that a Hell was real
 Well, I've seen Hell in Reno
             And this world's one big old Catherine wheel
 Spinning still
  
 [Chorus repeat]
 Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
 Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
 It takes a lot to change your plans
          And a train to change your mind
 Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
     Ooh, Maybe it's time to let the old ways die

 [Verse 1]
  
 I feel a filth in my bones
 Wash off my hands till it's gone
 Your walls they're closing in
 With velvet curtains
  
 Some love was made for the lights
 Some kiss your cheek and goodnight
 Lift up a red high heel
 Lock up your doors with steel
  
 They're making noise in my street
 My blinds are drawn, I can't see
 Smashed in my car window
 Didn't touch the stereo

 Slow it down

 Rest your arms and rest your legs

 Act like you've been here before
 Smile less and dress up some more
 Tie up your scarf real tight
 These boys are out for blood tonight

 Slow it down
            Angie come back to bed
 Rest your arms and rest your legs
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 And when she stood she stood tall
 She'll make a fool of you all
 Don't ask for cigarettes
 She ain't got nothing left for you
  
 I never, she never, we never looked back
 That wasn't what we were good at
 And when it came to love
  We were not good enough for it
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Slow it down
            Angie come back to bed
 Rest your arms and rest your legs

 Don't you frown when you're feeling like that
 Only love can pick you out of this

     If I could save time in a bottle
      The first thing that I'd like to do   - play riff in reg time
        Is to save every day till eternity passes away
          Just to spend them with you.
  
  
     If I could make days last forever
      If words could make wishes come true
        I'd save every day like a treasure and then
          Again, I would spend them with you.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
            But there never seems to be enough time
     To do the things you want to do Once you find them
       I've looked around enough to know
       That you're the one I want to go through time with.

      And dreams that had never come true
      The box would be empty except for the memory
          Of how they were answered by you

 Give me more lovin' from the very start
 Piece me back together when I fall apart

                  I love bein' around you

 You can come by any time you want
 I'll be around, you were right about the stars

 Lightning crashes...a new mother cries...
 Her placenta falls to the floor...
 The angel opens her eyes...
                     The confusion sets in...
            Before the doctor can even close the door...
  
 Lightning crashes...an old mother dies...
 Her intentions fall to the floor...
 The angel closes her eyes...
                             The confusion that was hers...
            Belongs now to the baby down the hall...

 [Verse 1]
  
 If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
 And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
 Would you hear my voice come through the music
 Would you hold it near as it were your own?
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
 Perhaps they're better left unsung
 I don't know, don't really care
 Let there be songs to fill the air
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Ripple in still water
             When there is no pebble tossed
      Nor wind to blow 
  
  
 [Verse 3]
                 Reach out your hand if your cup be empty
 If your cup is full may it be again
 Let it be known there is a fountain
 That was not made by the hands of men 
  
  
 Verse 4
 There is a road, no simple highway
 Between the dawn and the dark of night
 And if you go no one may follow
 That path is for your steps alone
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Ripple in still water
             When there is no pebble tossed
      Nor wind to blow 
  
  
 [Verse 5]
  
          You who choose to lead must follow
 But if you fall you fall alone
 If you should stand then who's to guide you?
 If I knew the way I would take you home

  I know she said it's alright

 I know she knows it's not right
    There ain't no use in lying
 Maybe she thinks I know something
         Maybe maybe, she thinks it's fine

 I know she loves the sunrise
    No longer sees it with her sleeping eyes

 Well it might not work because of other ties and
 I know she usually has some other ties
      And I wouldn't want to break 'em, nah, I wouldn't want to break 'em
    Maybe she'll help me to untie this but
 Until then well, I'm gonna have to lie too

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
 When I was younger I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind.
     He broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to re-assemble it.
      And my mamma swore she that would never let herself forget.
      And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love if it does not
   exist. But darling..
  
  
 [Chorus]
 You are the only exception
 You are the only exception
 You are the only exception
 You are the only exception
  
  
 [Verse 2]
                                     Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts.
      And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face.
      And I've always lived like this keeping a comfortable, distance.
      And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness,
         'cause none of it was ever worth the risk.
  
  
 [Chorus]
       Well you are the only exception
 You are the only exception
 You are the only exception
 You are the only exception

                I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up,
           Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream.
     whoa
  
  
 [Chorus]
 You are the only exception
 You are the only exception
 You are the only exception
 You are the only exception

 [Verse]
  
 I'm gonna make a change, for once in my life
 It's gonna feel real good, gonna make a difference
         Gonna make it right
     As I, turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
 This wind is blowin' my mind
             I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
 Who am I, to be blind? Pretending not to see their needs
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
 And a one man's soul
 They follow each other on the wind ya' know
               'Cause they got nowhere to go
 That's why I want you to know
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 I'm starting with the man in the mirror
 I'm asking him to change his ways
 And no message could have been any clearer
           If you wanna make the world a better place
                                            Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
  
 Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
 It's time that I realize
                  That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
                Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
 And a washed-out dream
        They follow the pattern of the wind, ya' see
             Cause they got no where to be
                               That's why I'm starting with me

 Jhoota hi sahi pyaar toh kar

 Roothega na mujhse mere

 [Verse 1]
   I fell by the wayside like everyone else
   I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself
   Our every moment, I start to replace
   'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
   When you hurt under the surface
   Like troubled water running cold
                               Well, time can heal but this won't
  
  
 [Chorus]
 So, before you go
                 Was there something I could've said
  
 To make your heart beat better?
     If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
 So, before you go
                 Was there something I could've said
  
 To make it all stop hurting?
     It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
 So, before you go
  
  
 [Verse 2]
   Was never the right time, whenever you called
   Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
   Our every moment, I start to replay
   But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
   When you hurt under the surface
   Like troubled water running cold
                               Well, time can heal but this won't
  
  
 [Chorus]
 So, before you go
                 Was there something I could've said
  
 To make your heart beat better?
     If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
 So, before you go
                 Was there something I could've said
  
 To make it all stop hurting?
     It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
 So, before you go
  
  
 [Bridge]
              Would we be better off by now
              If I'd have let my walls come down?
           Maybe, I guess we'll never know
                  You know, you know
  
  
 [Chorus]

 [Verse]
  
   Napatunganga nung bigla kitang nakita 
        pagkalipas ng mahabang panahon
   High School pa tayo nung una kang makilala
         at tandang-tanda ko pa noon pa may sobrang lupit mo na
   Hindi ko alang alam kung pano basta biglang nagsama tayo
   di nagtagal ay napaibig mo ako
  
 Mula umaga hanggang uwian natin laging magkasama tayong dalawa
        parang kahapon lang nangyari sa akin ang lahat 
 tila isang tulang medyo romantiko ang banat
 ngunit ng napag-usapan bigla na lang nagkahiyaan
 mula noon hindi na tayo nag-pansinan
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
     At bakit ko ba pinabayaan 
               mawala ng hindi inaasahan
            parang nasayang lang 
       nawala na      wala ng nagawa
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Panay ang plano ngunit panay ang urong
 at inabot na ng dulo ng taon
 Graduation natin nung biglang nag-absent partner ko
 tadhana nga naman naging mag-partner tayo
 eksakto na ang timing
   planado na ang sasabihin
 ngunit hanggang huli
   wala akong nasabi
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
     At bakit ko ba pinabayaan
               mawala ng hindi inaasahan

 bigla na lang napaligiran
 ng yong mga anak mula sa
 pangit mong asawa

 Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
           and it's so quiet in the world tonight
 your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreamin'
       so I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight

 [Verse]
 You're in the car on the way to the movies
             and you're mortified your mom's dropping you off.
 At 14, there's just so much you can't do
                and you can't wait to move out some day and call your own shots.
  
  
 [Pre-chorus]
 But don't make her drop you off around the block,
                                    remember that she's getting older too.
  
 and don't lose the way that you dance
   around in your PJs gettin' ready for school
  
  
 [Chorus]
 Oh, darlin' don't you ever grow up,
            don't you ever grow up
       just stay this little.
 Oh, darlin' don't you ever grow up,
            don't you ever grow up
           It could stay this simple.
 No ones ever burned you,
                            Nothing's ever left you scarred,
                              and even though you want to
  
 Just try to never grow up.

 [Bridge]
 Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room,
 memorise what it sounded like when your dad gets home.
              Remember the footsteps, remember the words said,
                and know your little brother's favourite songs.
 I just realised everything I have 
  
 is someday gonna be gone.
  
  
 [Verse]
 So here I am in my new apartment,
       In a big city, they just dropped me off.
 It's so much colder than I thought it would be,
       so I tuck myself, and turn my nightlight on.

 Dirimu di kala senja

 [Verse 1]
       Come over   to the window,  my little darling
 I'd like to try to read your palm
 I used to think I was some kind of gypsy boy
    before I let you take me home
  
  
 [Chorus]
      Now so long, Marianne,    It's time that we began
      to laugh      and cry   and cry      and laugh about it all again
  
  
 [Verse 2]
            Well you know  that I love to live with you
  but you make me forget so very much
  I forget to pray for the angels
               and then the angels forget to pray for us
  
  
 [Chorus]
      Now so long, Marianne,    It's time that we began
      to laugh      and cry   and cry      and laugh about it all again
  
  
 [Verse 3]
      We met when   we were almost young
  deep in the green Lilac park
  You held on to me like I was a crucifix
    as we went kneeling through the dark
  
  
 [Chorus]
     Oh so long, Marianne,    It's time that we began
      to laugh      and cry   and cry      and laugh about it all again
  
  
 [Verse 4]
        Your letters  they all say that you're beside me now
  then why do I feel alone
  I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
      is fastening my ankle to a stone
  
  
 [Chorus]
      Now so long, Marianne,    It's time that we began
      to laugh      and cry   and cry      and laugh about it all again
  
  
 [Verse 5]
       For now I need your hidden love
  I'm cold as a new razor blade
  You left when I told you I was curious
    I never said that I was brave
  
  
 [Chorus]
     Oh so long, Marianne,    It's time that we began
      to laugh      and cry   and cry      and laugh about it all again
  
  
 [Verse 6]
       Oh, you are really such a pretty one
  I see you've gone and changed your name again
  And just when I climbed this whole mountainside
      to wash my eye__lids in the rain
  
  
 [Chorus]
     Oh so long, Marianne,    It's time that we began
      to laugh      and cry   and cry      and laugh about it all again
  
  
 [Verse](I found this extra verse written out somewhere.
 Not on the original recording from the Best Of... Disc)
     Oh, your eyes, well, I forget your eyes
  your body's at home in every sea
  How come you gave away your news to everyone
 When you said it was a secret just for me

 I saw the sun begin to dim

     A man learns who is there for him
             When the glitter fades and the walls won't hold
  
   Cause from then, rubble
   What remains
      Can only be what's true

 City of stars
                               There's so much that I can't see
      Who knows?
                           I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you

                           Just one thing everybody wants
 There in the bars
                                     And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
       It's love
                                Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else
    A rush(A glance)
    A touch(A dance)
  
 [Chorus]
    To look in somebody's eyes
                   To light up the skies
               To open the world and send them reeling
    A voice that says, I'll be here
                And you'll be alright
    I don't care if I know
                    Just where I will go
                    'Cause all that I need's this crazy feeling
    A rat-tat-tat on my heart…

 [Verse 1]
  
 You tucked me in, turned out the light
 kept me safe and sound at night
 Little girls depend on things like that
  
 Brushed my teeth and combed my hair
 Had to drive me everywhere
 You were always there when I looked back
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
             You had to do it all alone
         Make a living, make a home
 Mustv'e been as hard as it could be
  
             And when I couldn't sleep at night
                Scared things wouldn't turn out right
 You would hold my hand and sing to me

 Caterpillar in the tree
 How you wonder who you'll be
 Can't go far but you can always dream
  
 Wish you may and wish you might
 Don't you worry, hold on tight
 I promise you there will come a day

 Got your wings, now you can't stay

0,How He Loves chords,How He Loves – John Mark McMillan,"So I could not find a tab for this song posted anywhere else so I listened to it myself
 believe I have the correct chords. It's actually very simple and easy to play.
  
 The whole song is based on the chord progression  the chords and another strumming them.
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 He is jealous for me
 Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree
 Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy.
       When all of a sudden,
                        I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
        And I realize just how beautiful You are,
          And how great Your affections are for me.
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 Oh, how he loves us so,
             Oh, how he loves us,
                  How he loves us so.

 [Verse 2]
  
     So we are his portion and he is our prize,
 Drawn to redemption by the grace in his eyes,
     If grace is an ocean we're all sinking.
     So heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss,
         And my heart turns violently inside of my chest.
    I don't have time to maintain these regrets when I think about the way...

 Hi everyone! So I made up this ACOUSTIC VERSION to help people who would like to play a
 Coldplay song,
 so it's not the album version (since it's basically a piano song...), but feel
 free for any comments
 or suggestions !!!
 So enjoy!!!
  
 EDIT AUGUST 11th 2010: Changed the lyrics, they are now accurate, they are from
 Coldplay's official website.

 EASY VERSION:
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
        Was a long and dark December
  
 From the rooftops I remember
            There was snow, white snow
    Clearly I remember from the windows
                              They were watching while we froze
          Down below
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
            When the future's architectured
       By a carnival of idiots on show
                   You'd better lie low
         If you love me, won’t you let me know?
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
        Was a long and dark December
  
 When the banks became cathedrals
        And a fox became God
   Priests clutched onto bibles
  
 Hollowed out to fit their rifles
           And the cross was held aloft
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Bury me an armour
           When I’m dead and hit the ground
                My nerves are poles that unfroze
         If you love me, won’t you let me know?

 [Chorus]
  
          I don’t want to be a soldier
         Who the captain of some sinking ship
       Would stow
      Far below
             So, if you love me, why’d you let me go?
  
  
 [Outro]
  
            I took my love down to Violet Hill
 There we sat    in the    snow
 All that time she was silent still

 So it's pretty much all there. For the distorted guitar fill during the verses (instead
 playing the Em (and Em6 for the complex one)),
 you can play the last 4 chords written in the ""guitar solo""...

 [Verse]
  
 Taking over this town, they should worry
 But these problems aside I think I taught you well
                That we won't run, and we won't run, and we wont' run
  
 And in the winter night sky ships are sailing
 Looking down on these bright blue city lights
                 And they won't wait, and they won't wait, and they won't wait
                We're here to stay, we're here to stay, we're here to stay
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Howling ghosts they re-appear
     In mountains that are stacked with fear
      But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
              A lionheart
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 His crown lid up the way as we moved slowly
 Passed the wondering eyes of the ones that were left behind
             Though far away, though far away, though far away
                  We're still the same, we're still the same, we're still the same
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Howling ghosts they re-appear
     In mountains that are stacked with fear
      But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
      And in the sea that's painted black
 Creatures lurk below the deck
      But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
      And as the world comes to an end
 I'll be here to hold your hand cause
 You're my king and I'm your lionheart

 Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
 Jack Frost nipping at your nose
   Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
      And folks dressed up like Eskimos

            Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
   Help to make the season bright
 Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
       Will find it hard to fall asleep tonight

                 They know that Santa's on his way
              He’s loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
            And every mother’s child is gonna spy
            To see if reindeer really know how to fly

      And so I’m offering this simple phrase
       To kids from one to ninety-two

 Merry Christmas to you

       Our whole universe was in a hot dense state,
              Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait...
      The Earth began to cool,
      The autotrophs began to drool,
         Neanderthals developed tools,
             We built a wall (we built the pyramids),
 Math, science, history, unraveling the mysteries,
       That all started with the big bang!
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
             ""Since the dawn of man"" is really not that long,
           As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song.
    A fraction of a second and the elements were made.
      The bipeds stood up straight,
      The dinosaurs all met their fate,
                They tried to leap but they were late
               And they all died (they froze their asses off)
      The oceans and Pangea
          See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya
         Set in motion by the same big bang!
         It all started with the big BANG!
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 It's expanding ever outward but one day
 It will pause and start to go the other way,
 Collapsing ever inward, we won't be here, it won't be heard
 Our best and brightest figure that it'll make an even bigger bang!
  
  
 [Solo]
  
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 Australopithecus would really have been sick of us
    Debating how we're here, they're catching deer (we're catching viruses)
    Religion or astronomy, Descartes or Deuteronomy

 Capo Third Fret and use standard chords.
  
 A couple of other tabs are right on the money with the
 actual chords however this gets a little confusing when
 using a capo. (Why complicate things) Just play the chords
 on the third fret as if there were no capo... SIMPLE.

 This is the general riff for the verse:
 He varies it a bit throughout the song, sometimes he just plays a normal C chord
 without the variation. Listen to the song to get a bit of a feeling of it.
 You can of course just strum the basic chords if you want.

             While your boyfriends pick up chicks
                  And darling I'm lost
              I heard you whispering that night in fountain square
                   The trash filled streets made me wish we were heading home.
  
                And there was love inside the basement
             Where that woman used to lie
       In a sleeping bag we shared
           Upon the floor almost every night
                  And darling I'm drunk
       everything that I have loved is turned to stone
               So pack your bag and come back home.

          And I'm wasted
          You can taste it

      Cigarettes, and outer space
              If somebody moves
       everything you thought you had will go to shit
              We've got a lot, don't ever forget that.
  
        And I wrote this on an airplane
            Where the people looked like eggs
             And when a woman that you loved was gone
          She was bombing east Japan
                    And don't fucking move

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse]
        And you,
      You bring me to my knees
   Again
            All the times
       Then I could beg you please
     In vain
                  All the times
     Then I felt insecure
 For you
            And I leave  
    My burdens at the door
  
 [Chorus]
                    But I'm on the outside
                    And I'm looking in
                   I can see through you
                  See your true colors
                       'Cause inside you're ugly
                   You're ugly like me
                  I can see through you

 [Interlude

              All the times
        That I felt like this won't end
       it's for you
             And I taste
      What I could never have
           It was from you
                  All the times
           That I've cried
           My intentions
            Were full of pride
            But I waste
    More time than anyone

              It's all inside
             And I feel
          All this pain
               Stuffed it down
              It's back again
            And I lie
          Here in bed
          All alone
      I can't mend
             But I feel
    Tomorrow will be OK

0,A Certain Romance chords,A Certain Romance – Arctic Monkeys,"[Verse 1]
 Well, oh they might wear classic Reeboks
 Or knackered Converse
 Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
 But all of that's what the point is not
                                  The point's that there ain't no romance around there
 And there's the truth that they can't see
 They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
 And if you could only see them, then you would agree
 Agree that there ain't no romance around there
  
 [Chorus]
      You know, oh it's a funny thing you know
        We'll tell 'em if you like
        We'll tell 'em all tonight

                Because their minds are made up
      And course it's all okay to carry on that way

 'Cause over there there's broken bones
 There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
   And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes
                       To see it's a little different around here
 Don't get me wrong, oh there's boys in bands
 And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
 And just cause he's had a coupla cans
                            He thinks it's alright to act like a dickhead

 What can I say, I've known 'em for a long long time
 And yeah, they might overstep the line

 No, not in the same way

0,Faith chords,Faith – George Michael,"Well here again another tab for the song Faith from George Michael.. It's really a cool song
 and if you got the rythm and stuff it's SO cool to play it.. First this is the strum:
  
  **  ** * *     **
 nvnv nvnv nvn n nv (n=downstroke, v=upstroke)
  
 It maybe looks a little weird (I have to admit), but the stars are where you have to damp
 your strings, hear the song if you don't understand
 me.. it's played very fast and I had to practise a long time before I
 could really play it, but if you can it's really cool like I said
 already.
 Here are all the chords:
  
 [Intro]
  
 |  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 | Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
 I know not everybody has got a body like you
 But I've got to think twice before I give my heart away
 And I know all the games you play because I played them too
  
  
 [Pre-chorus]
  
 | But I need some time off from that emotion
 Time to pick my heart up off the floor
 When that love comes down without devotion
 Well it takes a strong man, baby
 But I'm showing you the door
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 | Cause I've got to have faith
 I've got to have faith
 Because I've got to have faith, faith, faith
 I've got to have faith, faith, faith
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 | Baby I know you're asking me to stay
 Say please, please, please don't go away
 You say I'm giving you the blues
 Maybe you mean every word you say
 Can't help but think of yesterday
 And another who tied me down to loverboy rules
  
  
 [Pre-chorus]
  
 | Before this river becomes an ocean
 Before you throw my heart back on the floor
 Oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion
 Well I need someone to hold me but I'll wait for something more
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 | Cause I've got to have faith
 I've got to have faith
 Because I've got to have faith, faith, faith
 I've got to have faith, faith, faith

 do that, looks like you have to play the F#-chord in 8 strings in an impossible way..
  
 If there are no chords in the second pre-chorus and chorus it wants to say you have to play
 the other pre-chorus and chorus, but you already noticed I
 think ;)
  
 In the pre-chorus there are these chords: |B G#m |C#m
 The B is standing close to the G#m and the G#m close to the C#m.. It wants to say you have
 to play 2 seconds B and 2 seconds G#m, I would give you
 a sample of the strum:
  
  **  ** * *    **
 nvnv nvnv nvn n nv
 It's the same, but now you have to go to G#m after two seconds.. The C#m is just like I said
 already.
  
 Hope you like it, and rate and comment it!!

 [VERSE 1] (hold each chord)
  
 Something has changed within me
 Something is not the same
 I'm through with playing by the rules
     Of someone else's game
 Too late for second-guessing
 Too late to go back to sleep
 It's time to trust my instincts
 Close my eyes and leap
  
  
 [CHORUS 1]
  
               It's time to try
    Defying gravity
               I think I'll try
    Defying gravity
                        And you can't pull me down
  
  
 [VERSE 2]
  
 I'm through accepting limits
 'Cuz someone says they're so
 Some things I cannot change
       But 'till I try, I'll never know
 Too long I've been afraid of
 Losing love - I guess I have lost
 Well, if that's love
              It comes at much too high a cost
  
  
 [CHORUS 2]
  
             I'd sooner buy
     Defying gravity
              Kiss me goodbye
        I'm defying gravity
                        And you can't pull me down

 And if I'm flying solo
 At least I'm flying free

 i noticed there were no tabs for this song yet, so i had to give it a shot. i've only
 playing for a couple months, so this is a very simplified version. it sounds really good
 me when it's slowed down quite a bit from the original. hope y'all like it. :)

             Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof, you saw her bathing on the roof
      Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

      And from your lips you drew a Hallelujah

            | And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
            | Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime
  
           | But say a prayer, Pray for the other ones
             | At Christmastime it's hard, but when you're having fun
           | There's a world outside your window
            | And it's a world of dread and fear
           | Where the only water flowing
        | Is the bitter sting of tears
         | And the Christmas bells that ring there
         | Are the clanging chimes of doom
        | Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you
  
           | And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime
     | The greatest gift they'll get this year is life, Ohhhh
       | Where nothing ever grows
    | No rain nor rivers flow
 | Do they know it's Christmastime at all?
  
 | Here's to you
 | Raise a glass for everyone
 | Spare a thought this yuletide for the deprived
 | If the table was turned would you survive
 | Here's to them
 | Underneath that burning sun
 | You ain't gotta feel guilt just selfless
 | Give a little help to the helpless
 | Do they know it's Christmastime at

        All I know, time is a valuable thing
 Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
 Watch it count down to the end of the day
            The clock ticks life away
            It's so unreal, didn't look out below
 Watch the time go right out the window
 Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
     I wasted it all just to 
            Watch you go, I kept everything inside
            And even though I tried, it all fell apart
 What it meant to me will eventually be
          A memory of a time when
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
             I tried so hard and got so far
             But in the end it doesn't even matter
           I had to fall to lose it all
             But in the end it doesn't even matter
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 One thing, I don't know why
     It doesn't even matter how hard you try
 Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
         To remind myself how
             I tried so hard, in spite of the way you were mocking me
  Acting like I was part of your property
   Remembering all the times you fought with me
   I'm surprised it got so far
  
 Things aren't the way they were before
 You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""Bb"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Bb</span>   Not that you knew me back then
         But it all comes back to me

              I've put my trust in you

               And for all this
               There's only one thing you should know

 [Verse]
  
 I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
                                          The only evidence that you'd been here before
                            And I dont get waves of missing you anymore
 They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
 Never getting dry, so I get high
  
 Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
 Weeks pass in a blink of an eye and I'm still drunk by the end of the night
 I don't drink like everybody else
 Do it to forget thing about myself
 Stumbling forward in a head spin i got
  
 My minds with you but my hearts just not
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 So am I close to you anymore if it's over
 And there's no chance that we'll work it out
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
            Thats why you and I, ended over U.N.I
        And I said thats fine, but you're the only one that knows I lie
 You and I, ended over U.N.I
        And I said thats fine, but you're the only one that knows I lie
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Everybody said that we'd be together forever but I know, that I never wanna settle down, come 
 around
  
 break up the love like lego now
 Never wanna turn into another like you 
 Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views 
 Everything's great, not everything sure 
  
 Like you live in your halls and I live in my tour bus
 Now I'm in the position to be another stalker
  
 That everything I say always seems to sound awkward
 Like our last kiss it was perfect
  
 We were nervous, on the surface
 And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
  
 Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
  
 I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
  
 And go back to that day we fell in love
  
 Just on our first kiss
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 So am I close to you anymore, if its over
 And there's no chance that we'll work it out
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
            Thats why you and I, ended over U.N.I
        And I said thats fine, but you're the only one that knows I lie
 You and I, ended over U.N.I
        And I said thats fine, but you're the only one that knows I lie
  
  
 [Outro]
  
 Because if, I was gonna go somewhere
  
 I'd be there by now
 And maybe I can let myself down
 Ohh, I thinkin that im unaware 
                                          I keep my feet on the ground, and keep looking around to make sure I'm not the only one to feel low
             Because if you want...I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered 
       From all that I've done wrong
             And I know you'll say... that I'm the only one but I know that god made another one of me
     To love you better than I ever will

 I am not the one

 She's got smile that it seems to me
     reminds me of childhood memories,
         Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
 Now and then When I see her face
       she takes me away to that special place,
             and if I stared too long,
                              I'd probably break down and cry

 She's got eyes of the bluest skies,

 Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
        where as a child I'd hide,
       And pray for the thunder and the rain
       to quietly pass me by

 So this is my first tab, hope you enjoy.
 P.S.: This is a really great song to play with two acoustic guitars.
 P.P.S.: That chord Cadd9 is like a G but you put the fingers of the 6 string on the 5
 string at the same fret and the one at 5 string goes to 4 string at the same fret and the
 strumming is two down, two up, one down and one up.
 Good luck and put your rating of my tab and a comment please.

0,The Fox chords,The Fox – Ylvis,"Ylvis is really talented musically, in addition to being funny. Their chord selection
 here attests to that.
  
 I recommend listening to the song for the exact timing of the chords, but the way they
 are written here should provide some useful indication.
  
 This version makes a greater use of open chords, and those who are into using such
 chords should find it more suitable.

      Dog goes woof, cat goes meow,
                                  Bird goes tweet, and mouse goes squeek.
           Cow goes moo, frog goes croak,
                             And the elephant goes toot.
                   Ducks says quack,  And fish go blub
 And the seal goes ow ow ow
      But there's one sound
      that no one knows
 What does the fox say?

      Big blue eyes, pointy nose,
                           Chasing mice and digging holes,
       Tiny paws, up the hill,
                                 Suddenly you're standing still,
                  Your fur is red, so beautiful,
                            Like an angel in disguise,
                 But if you meet a friendly horse,
 Will you communicate by
 mo-o-o-o-orse? Mo-o-o-o-orse?

 [Verse 1]
      An empty street
      An empty house
     A hole inside my heart
       I'm all alone
       The rooms are getting smaller
     I wonder how
     I wonder why
     I wonder where they are
       The days we had
       The songs we sang together (oh yeah)
  
       And oh my love
       I'm holding on forever
   Reaching for a love that seems so far.
  
 [Chorus]
        So I say a little prayer
               And hope my dreams will take me there
             Where the skies are blue
      To see you once again my love
       Overseas from coast to coast
               To find the place I love the most
             Where the fields are green
      To see you once again
      My love
  
 [Verse 2]
     I try to read
     I go to work
       I'm laughing with my friends
      But I can't stop to keep myself from thinking (oh no)
     I wonder how
     I wonder why
     I wonder where they are
       The days we had
       The songs we sang together (oh yeah)
       And oh my love
       I'm holding on forever
   Reaching for a love that seems so far.

             Where the fields are green
      To see you once again
  
 [Bridge 1]

      To promise you my love
      To tell you from the heart

 Dream a little dream of me

     Just hold me tight and tell me you’ll miss me                     
     While I’m alone as blue as can be
 Dream a little dream of  me

   Still craving your kiss
    I’m longing to linger til dawn dear

     And in your dreams whatever they be
 Dream a little dream of   me

 This is the easiest way I've found to play this gorgeous song, use a capo on 1st
 fret for correct tuning if you like. For a beautiful melancholic touch (as in the
 actual song) scale down the base string for the first five chords of the verse. Enjoy!

 When the rain is blowing in your face                                  
 And the whole world is on your case             
 I would offer you a warm embrace
 To make you feel my love
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 When evening shadows and the stars appear
    And there is no one there to dry your tears
 I could hold you for a million years
 To make you feel my love
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 I know you haven't made your mind up yet
 But I would never do you wrong
 I've known it from the moment that we met
 No doubt in my mind where you belong
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
 I'd go crawling down the avenue
 There's nothing that I wouldn't do
 To make you feel my love
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
 And on the highway of regret
 The winds of change are blowing wild and free
 You ain't seen nothing like me yet
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
 There’s nothing that I wouldn't do
 Go to the ends of the earth for you
 To make you feel my love
 To make you feel my love

 [Verse]
 I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
                                             There was something so pleasant about that phase.
  
 Even your emotions had an echo
             In so much space
 And when you're out there, without care,
                     Yeah, I was out of touch
                                      But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
                  I just knew too much
  
 [Chorus]
                    Does that make me cra-zy
                    Does that make me cra-zy
                    Does that make me cra-zy
       Possibly
  
 [Verse]
 And I hope that you are having the time of your life
            But think twice, that's my only advice
 Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,
                        Ha ha ha bless your soul
                             You really think you're in control
  
 [Chorus]
                Well, I think you're crazy
                 I think you're crazy
                 I think you're crazy
            Just like me
  
 [Verse]
   My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
               And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them
 Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
                                  And it's no coincidence I've come
                            And I can die when I'm done
  
 [Chorus]
        Maybe I'm crazy
               Maybe you're crazy
              Maybe we're crazy
         Probably

     At first I was afraid, I was petrified
                Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
             But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
             And I grew strong, I learned how to get along
                And so you're back from outer space
                I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
                I should have changed that stupid lock I should have made you leave your key
           If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
            Go on now go, walk out the door
            Just turn around now 'cause you're not welcome anymore
 Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
                Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die
  
             Oh no, not I, I will survive
     As long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
           I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give

 Man of sorrows Lamb of God
 By His own betrayed
      The sin of man and wrath of God
      Has been on Jesus laid
  
 Silent as He stood accused
 Beaten mocked and scorned
 Bowing to the Father's will
     He took a crown of thorns

 [Verse 1]
 Another turning point a fork stuck in the road 
 Time grabs you by the wrist directs you where to go
 So make the best of these days and don't ask why
 It's not a question but a lesson learned in time
  
 [Chorus]
 It's something unpredictable in the end it's right
 I hope you have the time of your life.  
  
 [Verse 2]
 So take the photographs and stillframes in your mind
 Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
 Tatoos and memories and dead skin on trial
 For what it's worth it was worth all the while
  
 [Chorus]
 It's something unpredictable in the end it's right
 I hope you have the time of your life.

 I thought love was only true in fairy tales
 Meant for someone else but not for me.
 Love was out to get me
 That's the way it seemed.
 Disappointment haunted all my dreams.

                 Then I saw her face,
      now I'm a believer
 Not a trace

          I'm a believer! I couldn't leave her if I tried.

 I thought love was more or less a given thing,
 Seems the more I gave the less I got.
 What's the use in tryin'?
 All you get is pain.
 When I needed sunshine I got rain.

 I will ever send
  Sometimes it cuts so much

                                And I don't need no carrying on 
  
   Stand in the line just ahead of the law
   You're faking a smile with the coffee you go 
   You tell me your life's been way off line

 [Verse 1]
 I was a little girl alone in my little world
       who dreamed of a little home for me
 I played pretend between the trees,
      and fed my house guests bark and leaves
      and laughed in my pretty bed of green
  
  
 [Chorus]
           I had a dream
           That I could fly from the highest swing,
          I had a dream
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 Long walks in the dark through woods grown behind the park,
      I ask God who I'm supposed to be

       God answered in silent reverie. I said a prayer
           and fell asleep

 Now I'm old and feeling grey
     I don't know what's left to say about this life
                 I'm willing to leave. I lived it full and I lived it well
    There's many tales I've lived to tell
     I'm ready now, I'm ready now, I'm ready now
     To fly from the highest wing
         I had a dream

 tempo: ~103
  
 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 I've been living with a shadow overhead
 I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed
 I've been lonely for so long
 Trapped in the past, I just can't seem to move on
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away
 Just in case I ever need em again someday
  I've been setting aside time
   To clear a little space in the corners of my mind
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 All I want to do is find a way back into love
 I can't make it through without a way back into love
        Oh oh oh
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine
 I've been searching but I just don't see the signs
 I know that it's out there  
 There's got to be something for my soul somewhere
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
 I've been looking for someone to shed some light
 Not just somebody just to get me through the night  
 I could use some direction
 And I'm open to your suggestions
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 All I want to do is find a way back into love
 I can't make it through without a way back into love
 And if I open my heart again
 I guess I'm hoping you'll be there for me in the end
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
  
 [Verse 5]
  
 There are moments when I don't know if it's real
 Or if anybody feels the way I feel
 I need inspiration
 Not just another negotiation
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 All I want to do is find a way back into love
 I can't make it through without a way back into love

  The drought was the very worst
  When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
  It was months, and months of back and forth
  You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
     Hung my head, as I lost the war, and sky turned to black like a perfect storm
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
     Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
      That's when I could finally breathe
            And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
  
  
 [Verse]
  
  There was nothing left to do
  When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
  So I punched a hole in the roof
  I let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
         The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
     Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
      That's when I could finally breathe
            And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
    I think I am finally clean
  Said I think I am finally clean
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
     10 months sober, I must admit
     Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
     10 months older I won't give in
     Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it
  The drought was the very worst
  When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

         With a few red lights, a few old beds
            We made a place to sweat
                    No matter what we get out of this
                       I know, I know we'll never forget
  
 Smoke on the water, and fire in the sky
 Smoke on the water

 [Verse 1]
  
              Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
         Of the bluebird as it sings
      The six-o-clock alarm would never ring
         But it rings and I rise
           Wash the sleep out of my eyes
     My shaving razor's cold and it stings

 Oh what can it mean to a
   Daydream be liever and a    ho-ome coming quee -ee-een

 You once thought of me
       As a white knight on a steed
 Now you know how happy
        I can be               
          And our good times start and end
          Without dollar one to spend
      But how much baby do we really need

 Life is short but this time it was bigger

 Intro:
  
 Verse 1:
        In my eyes, indisposed,
         In disguises no one knows.
             Hides the face, lies the snake,
       The sun in my disgrace.
           Boiling heat, summer stench,
              Neath the black the sky looks dead.
           Call my name through the cream,
            And I'll hear you scream again.
  
 Chorus:
              Black hole sun,
             Won't you come,
       And wash away the rain.

 Verse 2:
         Stuttering, cold and damp,
             Steal the warm wind tired friend.
             Times are gone for honest men,
                 And sometimes far too long for snakes.
          In my shoes, a walking sleep,
          And my youth I pray to keep.
          Heaven sent hell away,
          No one sings like you anymore.
  
 Chorus:

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse]
  
    These are the days of Elijah,
      Declaring the word of the Lord,
        And these are the days of Your servant, Moses,
 Righteousness being restored.
      And though these are days of great trials,
      Of famine and darkness and sword,
         Still, we are the voice in the desert crying,
      ""Prepare ye the way of the Lord!""
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   Behold he comes, riding on the clouds,
                   Shining like the sun at the trumpet call.
     So lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee,
                    And out of Zion's hill, salvation comes.
  
  
 [Verse]
  
       And these are the days of Ezekiel,
     The dry bones becoming as flesh.
      And these are the days of Your servant, David,
     Rebuilding the temple of praise.
    And these are the days of the harvest,
     The fields are as white in the world.
      And we are the laborers in Your vineyard,
    Declaring the word of the Lord!

 [Verse 1]
   Everybody knows my name now
   But something 'bout it still feels strange
   Like looking in the mirror
  
 Tryna steady yourself and seeing somebody else
   And everything is not the same now
   It feels like all our lives have changed
   Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
  
 But it's killing me now
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
   What if you had it all but nobody to call?
                   Maybe then you'd know me
   'Cause I've had everything
                     But no one's listening
                          And that's just fucking lonely

 [Verse 2]
   Everybody knows my past now
   Like my house was always made of glass
   And maybe that's the price you pay
  
 For the money and fame at an early age
   And everybody saw me sick
   And it felt like no one gave a shit
   They criticized the things I did
  
 as an idiot kid

 I put a capo on 1st
  
  
 I see Your face in every sunrise
         The colors of the morning are inside Your eyes
 The world awakens in the light of the day
     I look up to the sky and say You're beautiful
  
  
 I see Your power in the moonlit night
         Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright
 We are amazed in the light of the stars
     It's all proclaiming who you are You're beautiful
  
  
 I see you there hanging on a tree
         You bled and then you died and then you rose again for me
 Now you are sitting on Your heavenly throne
     Soon we will be coming home You're beautiful
  
  
 When we arrive at eternity's shore
         Where death is just a memory and tears are no more
 We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring
     Your bride will come together and we'll sing You're beautiful

 I've been asked for strumming patterns, but it's fairly straightforward.
 Simply put, I think that it's just strumming, and then right before each change in
 chord, there's an accent on the off-beat.

 [Verse]
  
 Me and all my friends, we're all misunderstood.
        They say we stand for nothin', and there's no way we ever could.
                 Now we see everythin' that's going wrong with the world and those who lead it
           We just feel like we don't have the means to rise above and beat it.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                So we keep waitin',          waitin' on the world to change.
                We keep on waitin',           waitin' on the world to change.
         It's hard to beat the system, when you're standin' at a distance,
                So we keep waitin',           waitin' on the world to change.

        Now  if  we  had    the   power  to bring our neighbors home from war
                    They would have never missed a Christmas, no more ribbons on their door

                We keep on waitin',       waitin' on the world to change
         It's not that we don't care, we just know that the fight ain't fair

               Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
                    You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
   The wall to wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
 Oh-oh-oh-oh, you're a rock'n roll suicide
  
 [Verse 2]
                    You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it

   You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
 Oh no no no, you're a rock'n roll suicide

                  Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
          But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
   Don't let the sun blast your shadow

             They're so natural, religiously unkind

               'Cause I need something that can wash all the pain
            And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
               But your ghost, the ghost of you it keeps me awake
  
  
 [Verse]
  
                     Each time that I think you go
  
 I turn around and you're creeping in
                   And I let you under my skin
                       'Cause I love living in a sin
                 Boy you never told me
  
 True love was going to hurt
                     True pain that I don't deserve
                  Truth is that I never learn
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
  I keep going to the river to pray
               'Cause I need something that can wash all the pain
            And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
               But your ghost, the ghost of you it keeps me awake
  I keep going to the river to pray

            And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away

 [Verse 1]
 I'd like to be under the sea
 In an Octopus's Garden in the shade.
 He'd let us in, knows where we've been,
 In his Octopus's Garden in the shade.
 I'd ask my friends to come and see
 An Octopus's Garden with me.
 I'd like to be under the sea
 In an Octopus's Garden in the shade.
  
 [Verse 2]
 We would be warm below the storm
 In our little hideaway beneath the waves.
 Resting our head on the sea bed
 In an Octopus's Garden near a cave.
 We would sing and dance around
 Because we know we can't be found.
 I'd like to be under the sea
 In an Octopus's Garden in the shade.
  
 [Solo]
  
 [Verse 3]
 We would shout and swim about
 The coral that lies beneath the waves.
 Oh, what joy for every girl and boy
 Knowing they're happy and they're safe.
 We would be so happy, you and me.
 No one there to tell us what to do.
 I'd like to be under the sea
 In an Octopus's Garden with you,

 Like black holes in the sky.
  
  
 [Chorus]
 Shine on you crazy diamond.
           You were caught in the crossfire
     Of childhood and stardom,
 Blown on the steel breeze.
 Come on you target for faraway laughter,
 Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!

 You cried for the moon.

 Threatened by shadows at night,
 And exposed in the light.

 Where have you been?
 It's all right, we know where you've been.
 You've been in the pipe line filling in time,
 Provided with toys and scouting for boys.
 You bought a guitar to punish you ma,
 And you didn't like school,
  
  
 And you know you're nobody's fool.
  
     So welcome to the machine.
  
  
  
  
 Welcome my son,
 Welcome to the machine.
 What did you dream?
 It's all right, we told you what to dream.
 You dreamed of a big star.

     He loved to drive in his Jaguar.

           We're so happy we can hardly count.
 Everybody else is just green, have you seen the chart?
  
                                    It's a helluva start, it could be made into a monster,
        If we all pull together as a team.

 So, so you think you can tell,
               Heaven from Hell, blue skys from pain.
                       Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil,
                        Do you think you can tell?
  
  
                            And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts,
                  Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change,
                    And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?
  
  
  
  
 How I wish, how I wish you were here.
             We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
                                    Running over the same old ground. What have we found?
               The same old fears. Wish you were here!

 When we were younger
 We thought everyone was on our side
 Then we grew a little
                      And romanticized the time I saw
                       Flowers in your hair
                 See it takes a boy to live
        Takes a man to pretend he was there
  
 So then we grew a little
      And knew a lot
 And now we demonstrated it to the cops
               And all the things we said
                           We were self assured
               Cause it's a long road to wisdom
             But it's a short one to being ignored
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
           Be in my eyes

               Be in my heart
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 So now I think that I could love you back
 And I hope its not too late
 'Cause youre so attractive
         And the way you move
                       I won't close my eyes
           Cause it takes a man to live
             it takes a woman to make him compromise

           Be in my eyes

 Capo II
  
 [Verse 1]
  
           In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
           of ev'ry head he's had the pleasure to have known
                                   And all the people that come and go stop and say hello
  
 [Verse 2]
  
         On the corner is a banker with a motor car.
             The little children laugh at him behind his back.
                               And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain, very strange.
  
 [Chorus]
  
        Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
 There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back
  
 [Verse 3]
  
           In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hour glass and in his pocket is a
 portrait of the queen.
                                   He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine.

             Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
             The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
                                        And though she feels as if she's in a play
         She is anyway.
  
 [Verse 5]
  
           In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer.
             We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
                              And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain,
 very strange.

 [Verse]
 She lives in a fairy tale Somewhere too far for us to find
 Forgotten the taste and smell Of a world that she's left behind
 It's all about the exposure the lens I told her
 The angles are all wrong now She's ripping wings off of butterflies
 Keep your feet on the ground
 When your head's in the clouds

 Well go get your shovel
 And we'll dig a deep hole
 To bury the castle,

 Well go get your shovel

 Her prince finally came to save her   And the rest you can figure out

 Keep your feet on the ground

 Because your real life is tragic
 Yeah you built up a world of magic

 You can't feel it with your heart
 and I won't believe it
  
  
               But if it's true then You can see it with your eyes
  
 Even in the dark
              And that's where I want to be, yeah

     She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
       On a snow white Christmas Eve
 Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy
           With the baby in the backseat
        Fifty miles to go and she was running low, on faith and gasoline 
              It'd been a long hard year 
            She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention 
          She was going way too fast
      And before she knew it she was spinning
       On a thin black sheet of glass
          She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
 She didn't even have time to cry
           She was so scared, she threw her hands up in the air

           It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
          And the car came to a stop
        She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
 Sleeping like a rock
               And for the first time in a long time
      She bowed her head to pray
               She said I'm sorry for the way, I've been living my life
    I know I've got to change, so from now on tonight

 Oh, take it, take it from me
 Oh  whaaaa ooooh......

 [Intro] (pause after each chord except for   
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
         I can still remember yesterday,
                  we were so in love in a special way.
                         And knowing that you loved me made me feel
    oh so right.
  But now I feel lost don't know what to do.
                   Each and every day I think of you.
                     Holdin' back the tears I'm trying with 
    all my might.
  
  
 [Refrain]
  
                   Because you've gone and left me standing all alone.
     And I know I've got  to   face tomorrow on my own.
     But baby,
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
      Before I let you go, I want to say I love you.
   I hope that you're listening cause it's true, baby
   You'll be forever in my heart, and I know that
    no one else will do.
   So before I let you go, I want to say it...
         I love you.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
  I wish that it could be just like before,
                      I know I could've given you so much more.
                    Even though you know I'd given you all my love.
                  I miss your smile, I miss your kiss.
                   Each and every day I reminisce.   
          Cause baby it's you that I'm always dreaming of...
  
  
 [Refrain]
  
                   Because you've gone and left me standing all alone.
     And I know I've got  to   face tomorrow on my own.
     But baby,
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
  
      Before I let you go, I want to say I love you.
   I hope that you're listening cause it's true, baby
   You'll be forever in my heart, and I know that
    no one else will do.
   So before I let you go, I want to say it...
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
    Cause letting love go is never easy.
        But I love you so, that's why I set you free...
    yeahyeah. And I know, someday, somehow, I'll find a way
       to leave it all behind me. Guess it wasn't meant to be,
          (use the tab part)
  but baby...
  
  
 [Chorus 3]
  
       Before I let you go, I want to say I love you.
   I hope that you're listening cause it's true, baby
   You'll be forever in my heart, and I know that
    no one else will do.
  So before I let you go, I want to say it.
          So before I let you go, I want to say...
  
  
 [Coda]
  
        I love you...

 [Verse 1]
    There's no reason, there's no rhyme
      I found myself blindsided by
      A feeling that I've never known
         I'm dealing with it on my own
    Phone is quiet, walls are bare
      I drink myself to sleep, who cares?
      No one even has to know
        I'm dealing with it on my own
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Chorus]
                         I've got way too much time to be this hurt
            Somebody help, it's getting worse
              What do you do with a broken heart?
                   Once the light fades, everything is dark
                 Way too much whiskey in my blood
             I feel my body giving up
             Can I hold on for another night?
             What do I do with all this time?
  
 [Instrumental] x2
  
 [Verse 2]
   Every thought's when it gets late
   Put me in a fragile state
     I wish I wasn't going home
     Dealing with it on my own
        I'm praying but it's not enough
       I'm done, I don't believe in love
      Learning how to let it go
      Dealing with it on my own
  
 [Chorus]
                         I've got way too much time to be this hurt

             What do I do with all this time?
  
 [Refrain]
 I drive circles under street lights
                     Nothing seems to clear my mind
            I can't forget, it's inside my head so
 I drive, chasing Malibu nights
                    Nothing seems to heal my mind, 
            I can't forget

 [Verse 1]
 This is a story that I have never told
 I gotta get this off my chest to let it go
 I need to take back the light inside you stole
 You’re a criminal
                And you steal like you're a pro
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
             All the pain and the truth
    I wear like a battle wound
       So ashamed, so confused
          I was broken and bruised
  
  
 [Chorus]
                       And now I’m a WARRIOR
         Now I’ve got thicker skin
          I’m a WARRIOR
         I’m stronger than I’ve ever been
              And my armor
      Is made of steel you can’t get in
           I’m a WARRIOR
      And you can never hurt me again
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 Out of the ashes I am burning like a fire
 You can save your apologies
            You’re nothing but liar
 I’ve got shame, I’ve got scars that I will never show
 I’m a survivor
       In more ways than you know
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
                      Cause all the pain and the truth

 So if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of the hive 
 Will I choose water over wine and hold my own and drive, oh oh
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 It's driven me before, it seems to be the way 
             That everyone else get around

 [Spoken]
 So there was this woman,
 and she was on an airplane,
 and she was flying to meet her fiancé
 sailing high above the largest ocean on planet earth,
 and she was seated next to this man who... you know,
 she had tried to start conversations, but, only,
 really the only thing she had heard him say was just to order his Bloody Mary,
 and she was sitting there
 and she was reading this really arduous magazine article
 about a third world country that she couldn't even pronounce the, the name of,
 and she was feeling very bored... and very despondent
  
 and then... and then uh, suddenly there was this huge mechanical failure
 and one of the, the engines gave out,
 and they started just falling thirty-thousand feet.
  
 The pilot's on the microphone and he's,
 he's saying, “I'm sorry, I'm sorry, oh my god… I'm sorry” and apologizing,
 and, and she looks at the man and she, and she says,
 she says, she says, “Where are we going?”.
  
 And uh, and he looks at her and he says,
  
 (Begin muted strumming 16th notes)
 “We're going to a party.
 It, it's a birthday party.
 It's your birthday party,
 Happy birthday, darling. We love you very, very, very, very, very, very, very much.”
  
 And then um, he starts humming this little tune, and,
 and uh it kinda goes like this,
 it's kinda: 1, 2, 1-2-3-4
  
 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
 we must talk on every telephone get eaten off the web
 we must rip out all the epilogues from the books that we have read
 and to the face of every criminal strapped firmly to a chair
 we must stare, we must stare, we must stare
  
 we must take all of the medicine too expensive now to sell
 set fire to the preacher who is promising us hell
 and in the ear of every anarchist that sleeps but doesn't dream
 we must sing, we must sing, we must sing
  
 it'll go like this alright
  
  
 [Bridge]
 While my mother waters plants my father loads his gun
 he say death will give us back to god, just like the setting sun
 is returned to the lonesome ocean

 [Spoken]
 And then they splashed into the deep blue sea
  
        Oh, it was a wonderful splash
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 we must blend into the choir sing a static with the whole
 we must memorize nine numbers and deny we have a soul
 and in this endless race for property and privilege to be won
 we must run, we must run, we must run
  
 we must hang up in the belfry where the bats and moonlight laugh
 we must stare into a crystal ball and only see the past
 and into the caverns of tomorrow with just our flashlight and our love
 we must plunge, we must plunge, we must plunge

 [Verse 1]
  
            Nais kong magpakalasing
          Dahil wala ka na
        Nakatingin sa salamin
            At nag-iisa
         Nakatanim pa rin 
  
 Ang gumamelang
 Binalik mo sa`kin nang tayo`y maghiwalay
 Ito`y katulad
  
 Ng damdamin ko
                      Kahit buhusan mo ng beer ayaw pang mamatay
  
  
 [Pre-chorus]
  
 Giliw, wag mo sanang limutin
           Ang mga araw na hindi sana maglaho
       Mga anak at bahay nating pinaplano
    Lahat ng ito`y nawala
        Nung iniwan mo 'ko kaya ngayon
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Ibuhos na ang beer
           Sa aking lala mu  nan
 Upang malunod na ang
        Puso kong na hihi rapan
    Bawat patak anong sarap
      Ano ba talagang mas gusto ko
       Ang beer na ito
     O ang pag-ibig mo
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
            Nais kong magpakasabog
        Dahil olats ako
            Kahit ano hihithitin
           Kahit tambutso
           Kukuha ako ng 
               Beer at ipapakulo
                       Sa kaldero't lalanghapin
             Ang usok nito
    lahat ay aking gagawin
    Upang hindi ko na isiping
 Nag-iisa na ako
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Ibuhos na ang beer
           Sa aking lala mu  nan
 Upang malunod na ang

 [Verse]
 I dreamed a dream in time gone by
 When hope was high
                 And life worth living
 I dreamed that love would never die
 I dreamed that God would be forgiving
 Then I was young and unafraid
 And dreams were made and used and wasted
 There was no ransom to be paid
 No song unsung, no wine untasted
  
 [Chorus]
 But the tigers come at night
 With their voices soft as thunder
 As they tear your hope apart
 And they turn your dream to shame
  
 [Verse]
 He slept a summer by my side
 He filled my days with endless wonder
 He took my childhood in his stride
 But he was gone when autumn came
  
 And still I dream he'll come to me
 That we will live the years together
 But there are dreams that cannot be
 And there are storms we cannot weather
  
 [Bridge]
 I had a dream my life would be
 So different from this hell I'm living
               So different now from what it seemed
 Now life has killed the dream I dreamed.

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Chorus]
   Last Christmas I gave you my heart 
           But the very next day you gave it away.
   This year to save me from tears 
        I'll give it to someone special. 
  
  
 [Verse 1]
 Once bitten and twice shy
 I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
 Tell me baby, do you recognize me
 Well, its been a year it doesn't surprise me
  
 Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
 With a note saying I love you I meant it
 Now I know what a fool I've been 
              But if you kiss me now, I know you'll fool me again
  
  
 [Chorus]
   Last Christmas I gave you my heart 
           But the very next day you gave it away.
   This year to save me from tears 
        I'll give it to someone special. 
  
   Last Christmas I gave you my heart 
           But the very next day you gave it away.
   This year to save me from tears 
        I'll give it to someone special. 
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 A crowded room and friends with tired eyes.
 I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice. 
 My God I thought you were someone to rely on
 Me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.
  
     A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
    A girl under cover but you tore her apart. 
   Maybe this year maybe this year 
         I'll give it to someone special.
  
  
 [Chorus]
           Because last Christmas I gave you my heart
           But the very next day you gave it away.
   This year to save me from tears 
        I'll give it to someone special. 
  
   Last Christmas I gave you my heart

       And last Christmas
       And this year
             won't be anything like anything like

   Last Christmas I gave you my heart 
           But the very next day you gave it away.

 Well I can hear the whistle from a mile away,

 That train is a beauty makin everybody stare,
                                    But its only destination is the middle of nowhere,

 Cause there's victory in the Lord I say,

 Cling to the father and his holy name,
      And don't go ridin on that long black train,

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
  I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
                I know it's hard sometimes
  Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
                     I know it's hard sometimes
  Yeah I think about the end just way too much
                    But it's fun to fantasize
 On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was
                    But it's fun to fantasize
  
 [Chorus]
    Oh whoa, oh whoa
        I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
    Oh whoa
        I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
    Taking my time on my ride
  
 [Verse 2]
        I'd die for you, that's easy to say
                             We have a list of people that we would take
      A bullet for them, a bullet for you
                       A bullet for everybody in this room
          But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
             See many bullets coming through
    Metaphorically I'm the man
                               But literally I don't know what I'd do
        I'd live for you, and that's hard to do
                                Even harder to say when you know it's not true
         Even harder to write when you know that tonight
                                         There are people back home who tried talking to you
    But then you ignore them still
                                    All these questions they're for real 
                       Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
                       And would you ever kill?
  
 [Chorus]
    Oh whoa, oh whoa
        I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
    Oh whoa
        I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
    Taking my time on my ride

 [Verse 1]
  
         Lay a whisper on my pillow,
            leave the winter on the ground
            I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
         in the bedroom and all around
           Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                    It must have been love, but it's over now
                    It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
                    It must have been love but it's over now
                     from the moment we touched till the time had run out
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
         Make-believing, we're together
           that I'm sheltered by your heart
             But in and outside I've turned to water
         like a teardrop in your palm
             And it's a hard, winter's day, I dream away
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                     It must have been love, but it's over now
                    It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
                     It must have been love but it's over now

    [Verse 1]
                You'll say
        We got nothing in common
           No common ground to start from
            And we're falling apart
  
    [Verse 2]
                You'll say
            The world has come between us
            Our lives have come between us
              Still I know you just don't care
  
    [Chorus]
            And I said what about Breakfast at Tiffanys?
            She said I think I remember the film
               And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it
            And I said, well that's the one thing we've got

            But now your eyes see through me
          I guess I was wrong

           So what now?
             It's plain to see we're o-ver

 Desmond has a barrow in the market place
 Molly is the singer in a band
 Desmond says to Molly, ""Girl, I like your face""
            And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

 Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweller's store
 Buys a twenty carat golden ring
 Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
            And as he gives it to her she begins to sing

       You taught me how to be someone, yeah
  
 [Chorus]
  
 All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
 All these lights that can't blind me
                   With your love, nobody can drag me down
             But you're love, nobody can drag me down

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse]
         I only wanted to have fun
              Learning to fly, learning to run
           I let my heart decide the way 
             When I was young
        Deep down I must have always known
                     that this would be inevitable
             To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
               and bare my soul

                        who can't stand the reflection that they see
  
                 I wish I could live a little more

                              It's like they're scared of me
     I try to think of things to say

 Notes:
 Ok, so here goes.  C/G is a muted chord you just have to listen to the song
 to hear the pattern. I know there are at least two guitars in this song but
 this is just how I figured it out for one and it sounds ok to me.
 I definitely would like any kind of feedback on this as this is my
 VERY first tab work.
  
 Enjoy!  Johnny Cash is and forever shall be ""THE MAN""
  
 Below are the chord changes that have a little picking part to it.

  Ok, for the rest of the song you can basically listen and figure
 out the changes the pickings are all the same.  Here's the lyrics
 with the chords.
  
  
 [Spoken]
 And I heard as it were the noise of thunder.  One of the four
 beasts saying, ""Come and see"".  and I saw and behold a white horse
  
 there's a man goin' round takin' names and he decides who to free
  
 and who to blame everybody won't be treated all the same
                                           there'll be a golden ladder reaching down       when the
  
 man comes around
  
 the hairs on your arm will stand up at the terror in each sip
  
 and in each sup  will you partake of that last offered cup?  or
                                     or disappear into the potter's ground   when the
  
 man comes around
  
  
 [Chorus]
   Hear the trumpets hear the pipers        one hundred million
                angels singing    multitudes are marching to the big kettle drum
 voices calling and voices crying some are born and some are dying
                                 it's alpha and omega's kingdom come     and the whirlwind is in the
 thorn tree the virgins are all trimming their wicks  the
                      whirlwind is in the thorn tree
  
  
 it's hard for thee to kick against the pricks til armegeddon no
  
 shalam no shalom then the father hen will call his chickens home
  
 the wise men will bow down before the throne and at his feet
                                  they'll cast their golden crowns      when the man comes around
 whoever is unjust let him be unjust still whoever is righteous
  
 let him be righteous still whoever is filthy let him be filthy
                                             still listen to the words long written down       when the
  
 man comes around

 and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death,
 and Hell followed with him

 [Verse 1]
 There I was again tonight
 Forcing laughter, faking smiles
 Same old tired, lonely place
 Walls of insincerity
 Shifting eyes and vacancy
 Vanished when I saw your face
  
                       All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 Your eyes whispered 'have we met?'
 Crossed the room, your silhouette
 Starts to make its way to me
      The playful conversation starts
 Counter all your quick remarks
      Like passing notes in secrecy
  
         And it was enchanting to meet you
                      All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you
  
  
 [Chorus]
   This night is sparkling
 Don't you let it go
              I'm wonderstruck
           Blushing all the way home
                I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
                      I was enchanted to meet you
  
  
 [Verse 3]
      The lingering question kept me up
 2 AM, who do you love?
   I wonder till I'm wide awake
      And now I'm pacing back and forth
 Wishing you were at my door
    I'd open up and you would say 'hey'
  
     It was enchanting to meet you
                  All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
  
  
 [Chorus]
   This night is sparkling
 Don't you let it go
              I'm wonderstruck
           Blushing all the way home
                I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
  
   This night is flawless
 Don't you let it go
             I'm wonderstruck
           Dancing around all alone
                I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
                      I was enchanted to meet you
  
  
 [Instrumental]
              This is me praying now
  
 [Bridge]
   This was the very first page
   Not where the storyline ends
   My thoughts will echo your name
   Until I see you again
   These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
   I was enchanted to meet you
  
 Please, don't be in love with someone else
 Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
 Please, don't be in love with someone else
 Please, don't have somebody waiting on you

 Two days past 18, he was waiting for the bus in his army greens
      Sat down at a booth in a cafe there, gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
 He's a little shy so she give him a smile and he said would you mind
                                Sittin' down for a while and talking to me, I'm feeling a little low
               She said I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go
  
 [Verse 2]
          So they went down and they sat on the pier, he said ""I bet you got a boyfriend but I
                don't care, I got no one to send a letter to.  Would you mind if I sent one back here to you?""
  
 [Chorus]
 I cried
   Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
  
 Too young, for him they told her
   Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
 Our love will never end
   Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
  
 Never more to be alone
            When the letter says, a soldier's coming home
  
 [Verse 3]
          So the letters came from an army camp, in California then Vietnam
          And he told her of his heart, it might be love and all of things he was so scared of
      He said when it's gettin' kinda rough over here, I think of that day
                                  Sittin' down at the pier and I close my eyes and see your pretty smile
         Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while

 I cried
   Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
  
 Too young, for him they told her

      One Friday night at a football game, the Lord's Prayer said and the anthem
           sang, a man said folks would you bow your heads for a list of local Vietnam dead
   Cryin' all alone under the stands was a piccolo player in the marching band
      And one name read and nobody really cared
         But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair
  
 [Chorus]
 I cried
   Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
  
 Too young, for him they told her

 My best friend gave me the best advice 
                                              He said each day's a gift and not a given right 
 Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind 
                                         And try to take the path less traveled by 
 That first step you take is the longest stride

   2 AM and she calls me cause I'm still awake 
                                       ""Can you help me unravel my latest mistake 
                                         I don't love him. Winter just wasn't my season.""
   Yeah, we walk through the doors - so accusing their eyes
                                          Like they have any right at all to criticize
                                               Hypocrites. You're all here for the very same reason.
  
 [Chorus]
             Cause you can't jump the track 
              We're like cars on a cable 
      And life's like an hourglass glued to the table 
 No one can find the rewind button, girl 
     So cradle your head in your hands. 
     And breathe, just breathe, whoa breathe just breathe
  
 [Verse 2]
   In May he turned 21 on the base of Fort Bliss 
                                                  ""Just a day,"" he said down to the flask in his fist
                                            ""Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year.""
   And here in town you can tell he's been down for a while 
                                             But my God it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
                                        Wanna hold him. Maybe I'll just sing about it 
  
 [Chorus]
            Cause you can't jump the track 
              We're like cars on a cable
      And life's like an hourglass glued to the table 
 No one can find the rewind button, boys 
     So cradle your head in your hands. 
     And breathe, just breathe, whoa breathe just breathe
  
 [Bridge]
            There's a light at each end of this tunnel 
                         you shout cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out 
            And these mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again 
         If you only try turnin' around
  
 [Verse 3]
   2 AM and I'm still awake writing a song
                                        If I get it all down on paper it's no longer inside of me 
                           Threatnin' the life it belongs to.
   And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
                                                Cause these words are my diary screamin' out loud 
                                               And I know that you'll use them however you want to.

             We're like cars on a cable
      And life's like an hourglass glued to the table, 
 No one can find the rewind button now 
 Sing it if you understand...

                     It's like a broken record
                   Saying that your heart hurts
                Thought you'd never get over him getting over you,
                 And you end up crying
               And I end up lying,

     He treats you so bad and I'm so good to you, it's not fair.

                                     You say ""I'll call you tomorrow at ten""

 [Verse]
 Well I started out,       down a dirty road
 Started out           all alone
 And the sun went down,       as I crossed the hill
 As the town lit up,          the world got still
  
  
 [Chorus]
 I’m learning to fly,        but I ain’t got wings
 Coming down        is the hardest thing

 Well the good ol’ days,       may not return
 And the rocks may melt       and the sea may burn

 Well some say life        will beat you down,
 Break your heart,       steal your crown
 So I started out,        for god knows where
 I guess I’ll know        when I get there
  
  
 [Chorus]
 I’m learning to fly,        around the clouds,
 But what goes up          must come down

 [Bridge]
  
 Won't give you money, I can't give you the sky
 You're better off if you don't ask why
 I'm not the reason that you, go astray
 We'll be alright if you don't ask me to stay
  
  
 [Chorus]
 (N.C.)
  
              I'm singin Follow me, everything is alright
 I'll be the one to tuck you in at night, and if you
 Want to leave, I can guarantee
             You won't find nobody, else like me
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 You don't know how you met me, you don't know why
 You can't turn around and say goodbye
 All you know is when I'm with you
 I make you free
        And swim through your veins like a fish in the sea
  
  
 [Chorus]
 (N.C.)
  
              I'm singin Follow me, everything is alright

 [Verse 1]
  
     Summer comes,   winter fades,
 Here we are, just the same,
     We dont need pressure, we don’t need change,
 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""C"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">C</span> Lets not give the game away.
  
  
    There used to be an empty space,
      A photograph without a face,
      But with your presence and your grace, 
   Everything falls into place.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Just please don't say you love me,
            'cause I might not say it back,
          Doesn't mean my heart stopped skipping when you look at me like that. 
 There's no need to worry when you see just where we're at. 
 Just please don't say you love me 
 'cause I might not say it back.
  
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
    Heavy words are hard to take,
      Under pressure, precious things can break, 
      And how we feel is hard to fake,
      So let's not give the game away.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
        Just please don't say you love me,
            'cause I might not say it back,

 Fools rush in.
 And I've been the fool before,
                                       This time I'm gonna slow down,
                                     'cause I think this could be more,
                                  The thing I'm looking for.

        Just please don't say you love me,

 [Verse 1]
 We broke up a month ago
       Your friends are mine
                               You know I know you've moved on
  
 Found someone new,
            One more girl who brings out the better in you
      And I thought my heart was detached
       From all the sunlight of our past
       But she's so sweet,
  
 She's so pretty,
   Does she mean you forgot about me?
  
  
 [Chorus]
    I hope you’re happy
      But not like how you were with me
      I’m selfish I know, I can’t let you go
     So find someone great, but don’t find no one better
                     N.C.
 I hope you’re happy but don’t be happier
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
                                                 An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
  
 Remember when I believed
                         You meant it when you said it first to me?
      And now I'm pickin' her apart,
       Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
            But she’s beautiful, she looks kind
      She probably gives you butterflies
  
  
 [Chorus]
    I hope you’re happy
      But not like how you were with me
      I’m selfish I know, I can’t let you go
     So find someone great, but don’t find no one better
  
  
 [Bridge]
 I hope you're happy
     I wish you all the best, really
      Say you love her, baby
  
 Just not like you love me
       And think of me fondly when your hand's are on her
                     N.C
 I hope you're happy but don't be happier
  
  
 [Interlude]
 Ooooh oh oh ooooh oh oh ooooh oh oh ooooh oooh oooh oooh
  
  
 [Outro]
     I hope you're happy

     I hope you're happy

 But don't be happier

0,Ho Hey chords,Ho Hey – The Lumineers,"I've been obsessed with this song lately and decided that I would try to tab it out.
 I got the correct lyrics from their official website and tried my best to match them up
 with the chords.
 I'm not sure what the strum pattern is yet but I'll update it as soon as I figure it out...

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse]
 Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
 Counting my footsteps, prayin' the floor won't fall through, again
 My mother accused me of losing my mind
        But I swore I was fine
 You paint me a blue sky and go back and turn it to rain
        And I lived in your chess game but you changed the rules every day
 Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight.
         Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why
  
 [Chorus]
       Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
                            Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
      The girl in the dress cried the whole way home.
            I shoulda known.
  
 [Verse]
       Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame.
             Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away.
      And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
      Who don't understand.
                And I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said
          ""Run as fast as you can.""
  
 [Chorus]
       Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
                            Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
      The girl in the dress cried the whole way home.
  
       Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong.
                                 Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by your dark twisted games 
         When I loved you so?
            I shoulda known.
  
 [Bridge]
             You are an expert at sorry
      And keeping lines blurry
      And never impressed by me acing your tests
          All the girls that you run dry
       Have tired lifeless eyes
             'Cause you burned them out
      But I took your matches
    Before fire could catch me
     So don't look now
      I'm shining like fireworks
 Over your sad empty town
  
 [Chorus]
       Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
                            Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
      The girl in the dress cried the whole way home.       
     I see it all now that you're gone.
                            Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
    Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
    I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days

     It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone

              And I'll be gone gone tonight

    I drive all night to keep her warm and time
    Is frozen (the story of, the story of)

    I spend her love until she's broke inside
   The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
  
  
 [Verse]
  
    Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
    Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
      I know that in the morning now I see us in the light upon a hill
     Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still

 This sounds spot on ...
 Tuning depends on which version you find; some are whole step down, some half step, some standard.
 Tune down a half step to match original recorded version -

                                        Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
  
 Don't really know how I got here
 I got some pictures on my phone
                                       New names and numbers that I don't know
                                 Address to places like Abbey Road
                                       Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
  
 We're young enough to say
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 oh, this has gotta be a good life
                      This has gotta be a good life
                          This could really be a good life good life
      say oh this feeling that you cant find
                  This city is on fire tonight 
                          This could really be a good life, good good life
 ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 To my friends in New York, I say hello
                                 My friends in L.A. they don't know
                                                Where I've been for the past few years or so
  
 Paris to China to Col-or-ado
 Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
                                             Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
                                We all got our stories but please tell me-e-e-e
  
 What there is to complain about
  
  
 [Bridge 1]
  
 When you're happy like a fool
                   Let it take you over
                     When everything is out
  
 You gotta take it in
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 oh, this has gotta be a good life
                      This has gotta be a good life
                           This could really be a good life good life
      say oh got this feeling that you cant find
                       Like this city is on fire tonight
                          This could really be a good life, good good life
 ooohhhhhhhhhhh good good life
 ooh, yeahhhhhhhhhh
  
  
 [Bridge 2]  (actually only drums)
  
           Hopelessly
 I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
           Hopelessly
 I feel like the window closes oh so quick
           Hopelessly
 I'm taking a mental picture of you now
                'Cuz hopelessly
 The hope is we have so much to feel good about
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 oh, this has gotta be a good life 
                      This has gotta be a good life
                           This could really be a good life good life
      say oh got this feeling that you cant fight
                      Like this city is on fire tonight
                         This could really be a good life, good good life
   ooooh yeaaah....
   good good life, good life
 uuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  ohh

 Hindi mo ba alam na ako'y nasasaktan
                          Sa tuwing ikaw ay aalis at hindi nag paalam
 Nais kong malaman mo na ako'y nag tatampo
 Pag nalimutan mo ang pasalubong ko
  
 Hindi mo ba alam na ako'y nasasaktan
                          Pag nakikita kitang may ibang ka kwentuhan
     Nais kong malaman mo na ako'y nandirito
 Pwede ba ako kahit maki usyoso

 [Verse 1]
 I hear the drums echoing tonight
      She hears only whispers of some quiet conversation 
 She's coming in, twelve thirty flight
           The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
 I stopped an old man along the way
         Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies 
 He turned to me as if to say
 Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you
  
 [Chorus]
 It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
 There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
 I bless the rains down in Africa

 The wild dogs cry out in the night
     As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
 I know that I must do what's right

 I seek to cure what's deep inside...
 Frightened of this thing that I've become 
  
 [Chorus]
 It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
 There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do

 Ooh, na na, yeah
  
  
 [Verse 1]
   I saw you dancing in a crowded room
              You look so happy when I'm not with you
   But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
           A single teardrop falling from your eyes

   I don't know why I run away
   I'll make you cry when I run away

 [Verse 1]
  
 I gave all my oxygen to people that could breath
     I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
    I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
     Oh ho-o-onestly
  
 Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
 Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
 They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
           Its goes o-o-on and on 
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
    I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
      And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
             No farewell
              So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
    I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
         'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
   What line do we stand upon 'cause from here it looks the same?
      And only scars remain
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
    I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
      And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
             No farewell
              So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

           But if I don't, then I'll go back
                  To where I'm rescuing a stranger

                Oh, I'm here again
              Between the devil and the danger
         But I guess it's just my nature
              My dad was wrong
                          'Cause I'm not like my mum
                     'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
         But it helps
              So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

 Here's a thought for every man who tries to understand
                 what is in his hands  (what's in his hands)

 [Verse 1]
 Morning, it’s another pure grey morning
 Don’t know what the day is holding
          When I get uptight
          And I walk right into the path of a lightning bolt
  
 [Verse 2]
 Sirens of an ambulance comes howling
           Right through the centre of town and
           No one blinks an eye
         And I look up to the sky for the path of a lightning bolt
  
 [Verse 3]
 Met her as the angels parted for her
           But she only brought me torture
       But that’s what happens
             When it’s you who’s standing in the path of a lightning bolt
  
 [Chorus]
 Everyone I see just walks the walk with gritted teeth
             But I just stand by and I wait my time
               They say you gotta toe the line they want the water not the wine
             But when I see the signs I jump on that lightning bolt
  
 [Verse 4]
 Chances, people tell you not to take chances
             When they tell you there aren’t any answers
      And I was starting to agree
                               But I awoke suddenly in the path of a lightning bolt
  
 [Verse 5]
 Fortune, people talking all about fortune
          Do you make it or does it just call you
          In the blinking of an eye
         Just another passer by in the path of a lightning bolt
  
 [Chorus]
 Everyone I see just walks the walk with gritted teeth
             But I just stand by and I wait my time
               They say you gotta toe the line they want the water not the wine
             But when I see the signs I jump on that lightning bolt
  
 [Verse 6]
 It was silent, I was lying back gazing skyward
 When the moment got shattered
       I remembered what she said
                And then she fled in the path of a lightning bolt

   Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
                      Never have I ever before
  
  
 [Chorus]
      But I can see us lost in the memory
    August slipped away into a moment in time
                        'Cause it was never mine
      And I can see us twistin' in bedsheets
    August sipped away like a bottle of wine
                          'Cause you were never mine
  
  
 [Verse 2]
    Your back beneath the sun
                                Wishin' I could write my name on it
    Will you call when you're back at school?
                        I remember thinkin' I had you
  
  
 [Chorus]
      But I can see us lost in the memory
    August slipped away into a moment in time
                        'Cause it was never mine
      And I can see us twistin' in bedsheets
    August sipped away like a bottle of wine
                          'Cause you were never mine
  
  
 [Interlude]
  
  
 [Bridge]
    Back when we were still changin' for the better
                  Wanting was enough
                  For me, it was enough
                   To live for the hope of it all
                           Canceled plans just in case you'd call
                                 And say ""Meet me behind the mall""
                      So much for summer love and saying ""Us""
                      'Cause you weren't mine to lose
                      You weren't mine to lose, oh
  
  
 [Chorus]
      But I can see us lost in the memory
    August slipped away into a moment in time
                        'Cause it was never mine
      And I can see us twistin' in bedsheets
    August sipped away like a bottle of wine
                          'Cause you were never mine
  
  
 [Outro]
    'Cause you were never mine
         Never mine
                 But do you remember
      Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
              And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call
   Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
                       ""Meet me behind the mall""
     Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
               And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call
    Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
                        ""Meet me behind the mall""
      Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
               And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call
    Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)
           For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
             (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

 You know the bed feels warmer
 Sleeping here alone
 You know I dream in colour
      And do the things I want
  
 You think you got the best of me
 Think you had the last laugh
 Bet you think that everything good is gone
 Think you left me broken down
 Think that I'd come running back
 Baby you don't know me, cause you're dead wrong

 I don't have much to give, but I don't care for gold
 What use is money, when you need someone to hold
 Don't have direction I'm just rolling down this road
 Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold

 Pack up and leave everything, don't you see what I can bring
 Can't keep this beating heart at bay
 Set my midnight sorrow free, I will give you all of me

 Leave your lover, leave him for me

 Spare you the rising storms and let the river flow

 I bet this time of night you're still up
 I bet you're tired from a long, hard week
 I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
          Looking out at the city
      And I bet sometimes you wonder about me
  
  
  And I just want to tell you
          It takes everything in me, not to call you
   And I wish I could run to you
        And I hope you know that
 Every time I don't
     A -once
 I almost do,
     I almost dooooo
  
  
 I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
 'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply
 I bet it never, ever, occurred to you 
       That I can't say hello to you
            And risk another goodbye
  
  
  And I just want to tell you

 And I confess, babe

   And I almost do
  
  
      And I just want to tell you

 [Verse 1]
       Well if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say.
       I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way.
 For all the dirty looks, the photographs your boyfriend took,
       Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?
  
 [Chorus]
      I'm not okay.
             I'm not okay.
             I'm not okay.
                You wear me out.
  
 [Verse 2]
         What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
     I told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what they mean (I'm not okay)
 So be a joke and look, another line without a hook
     I held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look!
  
 [Chorus]
      I'm not okay.
             I'm not okay.
             I'm not okay.
                You wear me out.

 Forget about the dirty looks
        The photographs your boyfriend took?
       You said you read me like a book, but the pages are all torn and frayed
  
 [Chorus]
      I'm okay.
          I'm okay.
          I'm okay, now, I'm okay, now  
  
 But you really need to listen to me
 Because I'm telling you the truth
  
 I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust Me)

 Perjalanan ini terasa sangat menyedihkan 
 Sayang engkau tak duduk disampingku kawan 
 Banyak cerita yang mestinya kau saksikan

 Hati tergetar menampak kering rerumputan

 Gembala kecil menangis sedih oooo

 [Verse 1]
  
 You're on the phone with your girlfriend
 shes upset
 Shes going off about something that you said
 'Cuz she doesn't, get your humor
 Like I do
 I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
 I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
 and she'll never know your story
 Like I do
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 But she wears short skirts
 I wear T-shirts
 She's cheer captain
 And I'm on the bleachers
 Dreaming about the day
 when you wake up and find that what you're
 looking for
 has been here the whole time
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
 been here all along so why can't you
 see, you belong with
 me, you belong with me
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
 I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
 Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
 Hey isn't this easy
  
  
 And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
 I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
 You say you're fine
 I know you better then that
 Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 She wears high heels
 I wear sneakers
 Shes cheer captain and
 I'm on the bleachers
 Dreaming about the day
 when you wake up and find
 That what you're looking for
 has been here the whole time
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
 been here all along so why can't you
 see, you belong with
 me
 Standing by and waiting at your back door
 all this time how could you not know
 Baby....
                  You belong with me
                 ( You belong with me

 Oh
 I remember you drivin' to my house
 in the middle of the night
 I'm the one who makes you laugh
 When you know you're about to cry
 And i know your favorite songs
 And you tell me about your dreams
 Think I know where you belong
 A *strum*
 Think I know it's with me...

 You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you,

       You turned out to be the best thing I never had, 
           And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had, 
       Oh yeah, I bet it sucks to be you right now,

     it gave great light
      And so it continued both day and night.

      was their intent,

 It's annoying me that the other versions of this song here don't seem to have the
 words precisely right, or to have the chords properly aligned, so I thought I'd
 do my own version.
  
 I've transposed it into an easier key to play, as this way all the minor chords
 are in the open position. It's also a good key in which to sing it if you're a
 high baritone or a soprano, but if you want to play along to the CD then you need
 a capo on the 5th fret.

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
          Tell me where did you sleep last night
 In the pines, in the pines
            Where the sun don't ever shine
          I would shiver the whole night through
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 My girl, my girl, where will you go
      I'm going where the cold wind blows
 In the pines, in the pines
            Where the sun don't ever shine
          I would shiver the whole night through
 Her husband, was a hard working man
       Just about a mile from here
 His head was found in a driving wheel
          But his body never was found
  
  
 [Repeat Verse 1]
  
 My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
          Tell me where did you sleep last night

          I would shiver the whole night through
 Her husband, was a hard working man
       Just about a mile from here
 His head was found in a driving wheel
          But his body never was found
  
  
 [Repeat first verse loudly]
  
 My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
          Tell me where did you sleep last night

0,Über Den Wolken chords,Über Den Wolken – Reinhard Mey,"[Verse 1]
 ( Wind Nord-Ost Startbahn null-drei,
 Bis hier hör' ich die Motoren.
 Wie ein Pfeil zieht sie vorbei,
 Und es dröhnt in meinen Ohren.
                         Und der nasse Asphalt bebt,
 Wie ein Schleier staubt der Regen
                            Bis sie abhebt und sie schwebt
 Der Sonne entgegen.
  
 [Chorus]
 Über den Wolken
 Muss die Freiheit wohl grenzenlos sein.
 Alle Ängste, alle Sorgen, sagt man,
 Blieben darunter verborgen, und dann
 Würde was uns groß und wichtig erscheint,
 Plötzlich nichtig und klein.
  
 [Verse 2]
 Ich seh' ihr noch lange nach,
 Seh' sie die Wolken erklimmen.
                            Bis die Lichter nach und nach,
 Ganz im Regengrau verschwimmen.
                      Meine Augen haben schon
 Jenen winz'gen Punkt verloren,
                         Nur von fern klingt monoton
 Das Summen der Motoren.
  
 [Chorus]
 Über den Wolken
 Muss die Freiheit wohl grenzenlos sein.
 Alle Ängste, alle Sorgen, sagt man,
 Blieben darunter verborgen, und dann
 Würde was uns gross und wichtig erscheint,
 Plötzlich nichtig und klein.
  
 [Verse 3]
 ( Dann ist alles still, ich geh',
 Regen duchdringt meine Jacke.
                       Irgendjemand kocht Kaffee
 In der Luftaufsichtsbaracke.
                             In den Pfützen schwimmt Benzin,
 Schillernd wie ein Regenbogen.
                         Wolken spiegeln sich darin.
 Ich wär' gern mitgeflogen.
  
 [Chorus]
 Über den Wolken
 Muss die Freiheit wohl grenzenlos sein.

 Ketika kurasakan sudah ada
        ruang dihatiku yang kau sentuh
          dan ketika kusadari sudah
             tak selalu indah cinta yang ada

0,I Will Follow You Into The Dark chords,I Will Follow You Into The Dark – Death Cab for Cutie,"So I wrote this out when I was like 17 and hadn't looked at in years until I logged in,
 cheers for the snarky comments; I have taken them into consideration and fixed the chord
 progression at the end. Sounds fairly legit if you can get the picking pattern down right.
 (Also to the smart dude who made a comment about a bunch of the lyrics missing - props
 to you if you can pick out which ones they are, because I can't find them, sir.)

 [Verse 1]
   Love of mine, someday you will die,
                   But I will be close behind,
               I'll follow you into the dark.
  
       No blinding light, or tunnels to gates of white,
                    Just our hands clasped so tight,
           Waiting for the hint of a spark.
  
 [Chorus]
      If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied,
    Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs,
      if there's no one beside you when your soul embarks,
 I will follow you into the dark.
  
 [Verse 2]
 Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule,
             I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black.
     I held my tongue, as she told me ""Son, fear is the heart of love""
        So I never went back.
  
 [Chorus]
      If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied,
    Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs,
      if there's no one beside you when your soul embarks,
 I will follow you into the dark.
  
 [Verse 3]
 You and me have seen everything to see,
                    From Bangkok to Calgary,
            And the soles of your shoes,
  
       Are all worn down, the time for sleep is now,
                       But it's nothing to cry about,
                'Cause we'll hold each other soon in the blackest of rooms.
  
 [Chorus]
      If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied,
    Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs,
      if there's no one beside you when your soul embarks,
 Then I'll follow you into the dark.
 I'll follow you into the dark...

 [Verse]
  
 So this is how the story went
 I met someone by accident
 who blew me away
 who blew me away
  
         It was in the darkest of my days
           When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
      And buried them away
 Buried them away
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And I wish I could lay down beside you
 When the day is done
 And wake up to your face against the morning sun
 But like everything I've ever known
 you'll disappear one day
 So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 I dropped you off at the train station
 And put a kiss on top of your head
 I watched you wave
 I watched you wave
  
 Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
 Neon lights and waiting papers
 That I call home
 I call that home
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And I wish I could lay down beside you
 When the day is done
 And wake up to your face against the morning sun
 But like everything I've ever known
 you'll disappear one day
 So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 I woke up feeling heavy hearted
 I'm going back to where I started
 The morning rain
 The morning rain
  
 And you know I wish that you were here
 But that same old road that brought me here
 Is calling me home
 Is calling me home
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And I wish I could lay down beside you
 When the day is done
 And wake up to your face against the morning sun
 But like everything I've ever known
 You'll disappear someday
 So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
 And I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away

 Akala ko anghel at nananaginip lang ako
 Kaya dali-daling, at in-add narin kita
 Lumipas ang ilang saglit at ako'y in-accept mo na
 Laking tuwa, Bumilog ang mata, sobra ang saya
 Agad akong nagchat sayo para mapansin mo na
 Naging magkaibigan tayo, mabilis ang pangyayari
 Kaso nga lang langhiya, nung ang feelings ko'y sinabi
 Sabi ko ""gusto kita"" hindi nagpaligoy-ligoy pa
 Kaso lang tumanggi ka, kesyo may nalaman ka
 Mga balibalita lang na hindi naman totoo
 Fuckboy, manloloko tsaka sinungaling daw ako, nako

 Better stand tall when they're calling you out,
         don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down ! 
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 It's my life, it's now or never,     I ain't gonna live forever.
 I just want to live while I'm alive.
          It's my life, my heart is like an open highway,
 like Frankie said, I did it my way.
 I just wanna live while I'm alive.      It's my life !
  
 It's my life, it's now or never,     I ain't gonna live forever.
 I just want to live while I'm alive.
          It's my life, my heart is like an open highway,
 like Frankie said, I did it my way.
 I just wanna live while I'm alive.      It's my life !

 Capo II
  
  
 Looking in your eyes I see a paradise
       This world that I've found
          is too good to be true
 Standing here beside you,
 want so much to give you
       This love in my heart that I'm feeling for you
  
   Let 'em say we're crazy,   I don't care about that
   Put your hand in my hand, baby,
  don't ever look back
   Let the world around us  just fall apart
   Baby we can make it if we're heart to heart
  
             And we can build this thing together,
 standing strong forever
 Nothing's gonna stop us now
              And if this world runs out of lovers,
 we'll still have each other
 Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us now
  
 I'm so glad I found you
 I'm not gonna lose you
      Whatever it takes I will stay here with you
 Take it to the good times,
 see it through the bad times
      Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do
  
   Let 'em say we're crazy,   what do they know?
   Put your arms around me, baby,
 don't ever let go
   Let the world around us  just fall apart
   Baby we can make it if we're heart to heart
  
             And we can build this thing together,
 standing strong forever
 Nothing's gonna stop us now
              And if this world runs out of lovers,
 we'll still have each other
 Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us now
  
 Ooh, all that I need is you
 All that I ever need
      And all that I want to do
     Is hold you forever, ever and ever,
  
 hey
  
  
             And we can build this thing together,
 standing strong forever
 Nothing's gonna stop us now
              And if this world runs out of lovers
 we'll still have each other
 Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us now . . .

 N.C.                                 Darling, you've got to let me know,
 N.C.                                 Should I stay or should I go,
 N.C.                                 If you say that you are mine,
 N.C.                                 I'll be here 'til the end of time,
 N.C.                                 So you've got to let me know...
 N.C.                                 ...Should I stay or should I go?
  
 [Verse 2]
 N.C.                                It's always tease, tease, tease,
 N.C.                                You're happy when I'm on my knees,
 N.C.                                     One day it's fine, and next it's black,
 N.C.                                So if you want me off your back,
 N.C.                                Well, come on, and let me know...

 [Verse 1]
  
                         I've got another confession to make
             I'm your fool
                          Everyone's got their chains to break
             Holdin' you
  
  
                      Were you born to resist or be abused?
                         Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
                         Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
 Are you gone and onto someone new?
  
  
                          I needed somewhere to hang my head
                  Without your noose
                                 You gave me something that I didn't have
               But had no use
                         I was too weak to give in
                   Too strong to lose
                       My heart is under arrest again
                  But I break loose
                       My head is giving me life or death
                 But I can't choose
                      I swear I'll never give in
           No, I refuse
  
  
 [Chorus]

   I should ink my skin with your name
      And take my passport out again and just replace it
              See I could do without a tan on my left hand
                                  where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
               And I should run you a hot bath

   And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
   Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way
   And I know you love Shrek 'cause we've watched it 12 times
   But maybe you're hoping for a fairy tale too
              And if your DVD breaks today, you should've got a VCR
   Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say
              I know I've always been shit at computer games and your brother always beats me
           And if I lost, I'd go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
                        And then you laugh at me
  
 And be asking me if I'm gonna be home next week
                          And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep
              And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

           Just how beautiful you are to me

                             But you drink as much as me and I get drunk a lot
   So I’ll take you to the beach and walk along the sand
                                    And I'll make you a heart pendant, with a pebble held in my hand
   And I'll carve it like a necklace, so the heart falls where your chest is
   And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
   And it falls just where it needs to be
           And rests peacefully
                             So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now, 
            against yours now

 Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up

 [Verse 1]
                      I say remember this moment in the back of my mind
                              The time we stood with our shaking hands
       The crowds in stands went wild
                            We were the kings and the queens
                        And they read off our names
                                The night you danced like you knew our lives
         Would never be the same
                             You held your head like a hero on a history book page
                       It was the end of a decade but the start of an age
  
 [Chorus]
         Long live the walls we crashed through
                           All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
                          I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
                           And bring on all the pretenders
       One day we will be remembered
  
 [Verse 2]
                        I said remember this feeling I passed the pictures around
                            Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
             Wishing for right now
                            We are the kings and the queens, you traded your baseball cap for a crown
                         When they gave us our trophies and we held them up for our town
                      And the cynics were outraged screaming, ""this is absurd""
                         'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in
 ripped up jeans got to rule the world
  
 [Chorus]
         Long live the walls we crashed through
                           All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
                          I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""

                            That you'll stand by me forever
          But if God forbid fate should step in
                       And force us into a goodbye
                            If you have children someday
                          When they point to the pictures
                       Please tell them my name
                      Tell them how the crowds went wild
                   Tell them how I hope they shine
  
 [Chorus]

 With dream comfort memory to spare,
 and in my mind I still need a place to go,
 All my changes were there,

 Yellow moon on the rise,
 Big birds flying across the sky,
 Throwing shadows on our eyes.

 Baby can you hear me now?
 The chains are locked and tied across the door,
 Baby, sing with me some how.

 Good luck on figuring out the strumming pattern. It's to random to describe so listen
 to the song and you should be able to figure it out.

 Nothing Unusual Nothing Strange
 Close to nothing at all
 The same old scenario the same old rain
 And there's no explosions here
 Then something unusual something strange
 Comes from nothing at all
 I saw a spaceship fly by your window
 Did you see it dissapear
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Amie come sit on my wall
 And read me the story of O
 And tell it like you still believe
                      That the end of the century
           Brings a change for you and me
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Nothing unusual nothings changed
 Just a little older thats all
 You know when you've found it
 There's someting I've learned
 Cause you feel it when they take it away
 hey hey hey...
 Something unusual something strange
 Comes from nothing at all
 But I'm not a miracle and you are not a saint
 Just another soldier on a road to nowhere
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Amie come sit on my wall
 And read me the story of O
 And tell it like you still believe

 [Verse 1]
           I got no excuses
      For all of these goodbyes
                    Call me when it's over
                   'Cause I'm dying inside
                      Wake me up when the shakes are gone
          And the cold sweats disappear
                    Call me when it's over
                  And myself has reappeared

 I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
 I do it every, every, every time

 And I don't wanna fight
 I try and I try and I try and I try and I try
       Just hold me, I'm lonely

                  Let's go to the beach, each
  
 Let's go get away
 They say, what they gonna say?
          Have a drink, clink, found the bud light
     Bad bitches like me, is hard to come by
      The patron on, let's go get it on
    The zone on, yes, I'm in the zone
       Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
        I'mma blow all my money and don't give two shits

              I'm on the floor, floor
   I love to dance
             So give me more more, till I can't stand
               Get on the floor, floor
            Like it's your last chance
               If you want more, more
       Then here I am
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Starships were meant to fly
 Hands up, and touch the sky
 Can't stop, 'cause we're so high
 Let's do this one more time
 Starships were meant to fly
 Hands up, and touch the sky
 Let's do this one last time
 Can't stop

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
      You tucked me in
         Turned out the light
 Kept me safe and sound at night
 Little girls depend on things like that
 Brushed my teeth and combed my hair
 Had to drive me every where
 You were always there when I looked back
  
 [Verse 2]
             You had to do it all alone
         Make a living, make a home
 Must have bin as hard as it could be
             And when I couldn't sleep at night
                Scared things wouldn't turn out right
 You would hold my hand and sing to me
  
 [Verse 3]
 Caterpillar in the tree
 How you wonder who you'll be
 Can't go far but you can always dream
 Wish you may and wish you might
 Don't you worry, hold on tight
    I promise you there will come a day
 Butterfly fly away
  
 [Verse 4]
 Butterfly fly away(butterfly fly away)
 Got your wings now you can't stay
 Take those dreams and make them all come true
 Butterfly fly away(butterfly fly away)
 You've bin waiting for this day
 All along and known just what to do

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 Headed down south to the land of the pines, I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
 Starin’ up the road and pray to God I see headlights
 I made it down the coast in seventeen hours,  Pickin’ me a bouquet of 
     dogwood flowers
 And I'm a hopin’ for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
  
 [Chorus]
  
      So rock me mama like a wagon wheel, Rock me mama anyway you feel
 Hey… mama rock me
 Rock me mama like the wind and the rain, Rock me mama like a south-bound train
 Hey… mama rock me
  
 [Break]
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Runnin' from the cold up in New England, I was born to be a fiddler in an 
   old-time string band
 My baby plays the guitar, I pick a banjo now 
 Oh, the North country winters keep a gettin’ me now, Lost my money playin’
              poker so I had to up and leave
 But I ain’t a turnin’ back to livin’ that old life no more
  
 [Chorus]
  
      So rock me mama like a wagon wheel, Rock me mama anyway you feel
 Hey… mama rock me
 Rock me mama like the wind and the rain, Rock me mama like a south-bound train
 Hey… mama rock me

 Strum each note once:
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke, I caught a trucker out of Philly, had
     a nice long toke
       But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap to Johnson City, Tennessee
  
 Back to normal strumming pattern:
 And I gotta get a move on fit for the sun, I hear my baby callin’ my name,
         and I know that she's the only one
 And if I die in Raleigh, at least I will die free

 [Verse 1]
 Cotton wool fallin' like snow in July
 Sunset, riverside, 4 wheel drive
        and a tail light circle
 Roll down the windows turn it on up
 Pour a little crown in a dixie cup
          Get the party, started
  
  
 [Chorus]
     Girl, you make my speakers go BOOM BOOM
    Dancin' on the tailgate in the full moon
    That kinda thing makes a man go mmm mmm
         You're lookin' so good in what's a-left of those blue jeans
    Drip of honey on the money maker, gotta be

 Intro:  Verse 1:
 Is it getting better;         or do you feel the same
 Will it make it easier on you? Now you got someone to blame
 Chorus 1:
          You say; One love; One life; When it's one need; in the night
 Its one love; we get to share it; It leaves you baby; If you don't care for it
  
 Verse 2:
 Did I disappoint you?      Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
 You act like you never had love;     and you want me to go without
  
       Well it's too late;    tonight;   to drag the past out;   into the light
 We're one;   but we're not the same;   we get to carry each other
 Carry each other; One

 Have you come here for forgiveness? Have you come to raise the dead?
 Have you come here to play Jesus?    To the lepers in your head

 We're one; but we're not the same; well we hurt each other

 Love is a temple; Love a higher law; Love is a temple; Love the higher law
 You ask me to enter; but then you make me crawl
 And I can't be holding on, to what you got
 When all you got is hurt

 [Verse 1]
                   I'm through with standing in line to clubs we'll never get in
                It's like the bottom of the ninth and I'm never gonna win
       This life hasn't turned out quite the way I want it to be
  
           I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
        And a bathroom I can play baseball in
        And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me
  
              I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
        And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
        Gonna join the mile high club at thirty seven thousand feet
  
           I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
         My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
      Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me

            I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame

        We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
            And we'll hang out in the coolest bars

        Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there

               I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
        Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
           Sign a couple autographs
                              So I can eat my meals for free
              I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
          Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
         Gonna date a centerfold that loves
                        To blow my money for me

 This looks difficult but it really is not. Since the song has not been
 officially released yet, I had to look at Chris' fingers when they played the
 song for the first time live at the ""Rock Am Ring 2011"". This is pretty much
 the way he plays the song, I'm just not 100% sure with the lyrics! For an
 easier version without capo and in Standard Tuning look below. Enjoy! :)

     Oh morning come bursting the clouds move in
 lift off this blindfold let me see again
      and bring back the water that your ships will rid
        in my heart she left a whole.
  
      The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties
      the devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
      and I just wanna be there when the lightning strikes
          and the saints go marching in.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
           And sing sloooo-ooooo-ooooo-oooow it down
                      through chaos as it swirls
                           it's just us against the world.
  
  
 [Verse]
  
         Like a river to a raindrop I lost a friend
     my drunken as a dagger in a lion's den
      and tonight I know it all has to begin again
     so whatever you do don't let go.
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
                  And if we could float away
 fly up to the surface we'll just start again
      and lift off with no trouble
       just erodes us in the rain
  
 just erodes us in the rain
        just erodes us just erodes us in the rain.

 Ziggy Stardust, by David Bowie, Tabbed by Mark Willett
  
  
 [Intro]
  
 |   
  
 [Verse 1]
  
  Now Ziggy played guitar,
   Jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
             And the Spiders from Mars.
                         He played it left hand,
                      But made it too far.
                 Became the special man,
               Then we were Ziggy's band.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Ziggy really sang,
 screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo,
                like some cat from Japan.
                            He could lick 'em by smiling,
                          he could leave them to hang.
                  They came on so loaded, man,
             well hung, snow white tan....
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   So where were the spiders,
            While the fly tried to break our balls?
              Just the beer light to guide us,
     so we bitched about his fans
 and should we crush his sweet hands?
  
  
 [Interlude]
  
 |   
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 Ziggy played for time,
 Jiving us that we were voodoo.
           The kids were just crass,
             He was the nazz,
                 With God given ass.
             He took it all too far,
                     But, boy, Could he play guitar!
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
  
 Making love with his ego,
        Ziggy sucked up into his mind,
         Like a leper Messiah,
       When the kids had killed the man
 I had to break up the band!
  
  
 [Interlude]

            At nag-iisa

 Binalik mo sa`kin nang tayo`y maghiwalay

 [Verse 1]
 I want you to know that I'm happy for you.
 I wish nothing but the best for you both.
           An older version of me Is she perverted like me?
                Would she go down on you in a theater?
                 Does she speak eloquently? And would she have your baby?
                 I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother.

                wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide. No,
 and every time you speak her name
           does she know how you told me you'd hold me
     until you died? Till you died, but you're still alive.
  
 [Chorus]
          And I'm here to remind you
             of the mess you left when you went away.
           It's not fair to deny me
           of the cross I bear that you gave to me.
 You, you, you oughta know.
  
 [Verse 2]
 You seem very well.
 Things look peaceful.
 I'm not quite as well.
 I thought you should know.
            Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity?
            I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner.
           It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced,
               and are you thinking of me when you fuck her?
  
 [Pre-Chorus]

 [Interlude]
  
 [Bridge]
            Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me,
           and I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes, and you know it.
      And every time I scratch my nails down
 someone else's back
             I hope you feel it. Can you feel it?
  
 [Chorus]
          And I'm here to remind you
             of the mess you left when you went away.
           It's not fair to deny me
           of the cross I bear that you gave to me.
 You, you, you oughta know.

 [Verse]
  
     Ziggy played guitar,    jamming good 
                 with Wierd and Gilly and the Spiders from Mars.
  
                    He played it left hand, but made it too far 
                became the special man, and we were Ziggy's band.
  
      Ziggy really sang, with screwed up eyes and 
                screwed down hairdo like some cat from Japan.
  
                        He could lick 'em by smiling, he could leave 'em to hang.
                 He came on so loaded man, well hung and snow-white tan.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
      But where were the spiders, 
      while the fly tried to break our balls.
      Just the beer light to guide us. 
  
            And so we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands.
  
  
 [Power section] x2
  
  
 [Verse]
  
     Ziggy played for time, jiving us that 
          we were voodoo and the kids was just crass.
             He was the nazz with God-given ass. 
             He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
     Making love with his ego, 
     Ziggy sucked up into his mind 
     Like a leper messiah.
  
           When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.

 NOTES: on D* and F*
    D* is used in the [power] section.  I play a normal D and used my 'pinky'
    on the 3rd fret on alternate strums to acheive the (D D* D D* etc) sound on
    the record. I think D* is actually Dsus but I'm not sure.
  
    F* is used in the chorus. I pay the F chord as a barre chord (see tab above)
    and lift my first (barre) finger on alternate strums.
  
    I guess you really have to listen to the record to get the [chorus] and
    [power] sections timed/played correctly.
  
 Anyway, there it is.  By no means an expert opinion, but it seems to impress my
 flat-mate.

 Title: Like A Star
  
  
 [Hook]
  
               Just like a star across my sky,
               Just like an angel off the page,
               You have appeared to my life,
               Feel like I'll never be the same,
               Just like a song in my heart,
               Just like oil on my hands,
        Honor to love you,
            
  
 [Hook]
  
 Still I wonder why it is,          
                     I don't argue you like this,
        With anyone but you, 
        We do it all the time,
                  Blowing out my mind,
  
  
 [Verse]
  
               You've got this look I can't describe,
               You make me feel like I'm alive,
               When everything else is au fait,
               Without a doubt you're on my side,
               Heaven has been away too long,
               Can't find the words to write this song,
             Of your love,
  
  
 [Hook]
  
 Still I wonder why it is,

        With anyone but you, 
        We do it all the time,
                  Blowing out my mind,        
  
 Yea...
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
             Now I have come to understand the way it is,
             it's not a secret anymore,
               'cause we've been through that before,
      Dm7                            E7b9#5
 From tonight I know that you're the only one,
            I've been confused and in the dark,
            Now I understand,
  
  
 [Hook]
  
 I wonder why it is,
                     I don't argue you like this,
        With anyone but you,
 I wonder why it is,
                     I wont let my guard down,
        For anyone but you
        We do it all the time,
                  Blowing out my mind,

 Come to decide that the things that I tried  
       Were in my life just to get high on  
 When I sit alone come get a little known
 But I need more than myself this time  
 Step from the road to the sea to the sky  
        And I do believe what we rely on  
 When I lay it on   
 Come get to play it on  
 All my life to sacrifice

 When will I know that I really can't go  
         To the well one more time to decide on  
 When it's killing me   
 When will I really see  
                     All that I need to look inside  
 Come to believe that I better not leave  
                  Before I get my chance to ride  
 When it's killing me   
 When will I really see  
 All that I need to look inside

 Privately divided by  a world  so undecided

 In between the cover of another perfect wonder

0,Too Much To Ask chords,Too Much To Ask – Niall Horan,"Artist: Niall Horan
 Song: Too Much To Ask
 Album: Flicker
 Key: A minor
 BPM: 78
 Tabbed by: Matty Sievers
  
 Official Song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cfL9nTNugM
  
 EDIT: The official audio was released an hour ago so lyrics and chord placement is fixed.
  
 Niall often starts words on the offbeat; so the chord will change and then half a beat later he'll
 sing the line. So the best bet to play this song right is read the below progression outline and go
 off that as opposed to his words as that might be difficult for some. But you can also listen through
 and get the feel for the track.
  
 Intro and verse is Am for (2) beats, G for (2) beats and then C for (4) beats.
 Pre-chorus is Dm for (2) and C for (2) then after playing that three times it's G for (4) beats.
 The chorus is the progression of F, C, Am and G, each played for 2 beats, played through four times.
 The post-chorus is the same progression played through twice. That's when the lead guitar comes in.
 The first part of the final chorus is just whole notes then back to normal strumming
 when the full band comes in. Likewise for the outro - WHOLE NOTES :)
  
  
 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
   Waiting here for someone
   Only yesterday we were on the run
   You smiled back at me and your face lit up the sun
         Now I'm waiting here for someone
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
       And, oh love, do you feel this rough
   Why's it only you I'm thinking of
  
 [Chorus]
   My shadow's dancing
   Without you for the first time
   My heart is hoping
   You'll walk right in tonight
 Tell me there are things that you regret
        Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet
   That's all I'm asking
   Is it too much to ask?
  
 [Post-Chorus]
       Is it too much to ask?
  
 [Verse 2]
   Someone's moving outside
   The lights come on and down the drive
   I forget you're not here when I close my eyes
   Do you still think of me sometimes?
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
       And, oh love, watch the sun coming up 
   Don’t it feel fucked up we're not in love
  
 [Chorus 2]
   My shadow's dancing
   Without you for the first time
   My heart is hoping
   You'll walk right in tonight
      And tell me there are things that you regret
        Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet
   That's all I'm asking

    I know I stand in line until you
 think you have the time to spend an evening with me
      And if we go someplace to dance I know that there's a chance
               you won't be leaving with me
      And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place

        I can see it in your eyes that you despise the same old lines 
                you heard the night before
      And though it's just a line to you for me it's true
                      and never seemed so right before
    I practice everyday to find some clever lines to say 
              to make the meaning come true
      But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
          And I'm alone with you
      The time is right your perfume fills my head the stars get red 
             and on the nights so blue

 Plucked her eyebrows on the way
 Shaved her legs and then he was a she

 Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
 Said hey honey, take a walk on the wild side

 A hustle here and a hustle there

 Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
 Looking for soul food and a place to eat
 Went to the Apollo, you should have seen him go, go go
  
 They said

 Hey Sugar, take a walk on the wild side
 Said hey honey, take a walk on the wild side
                All right... huh

 Jackie is just speeding away
 Thought she was James Dean for a day
 Then I guess she had to crash
 Valium would have helped that fast
  
 She said

 Said hey honey, take a walk on the wild side

        It’s been a long time since I came around
 Been a long time but I’m back in town
 This time I’m not leaving without you

 This time I’m not leaving without you

 Sit back down on the couch where we

 And you said to me (there's)

 It's been two years since I let you go,
             I couldn't listen to a joke or rock n' roll
 Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart

         With a guitar humming and no clothes
 This time I'm not leaving without you

           There is Love that came for us

           We don't see what we used to see
             We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
 Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

 [Enter Drums 1] (4/4)
  
  
 [Verse 1] (6/4)
    Before the story begins,     is it such a sin,
    For me to take what's mine,    until the end of time?
    We were more than friends,     before the story ends,
    And I will take what's mine, create what God would never design
  
    Our love had been so strong for far too long,
    I was weak with fear that something would go wrong,
    Before the possibilities came true,
    I took all possibility from you
  
  
 Almost laughed myself to tears, (CRAZY LAUGHTER)
 Conjuring her deepest fears  (COME HERE YA’ FUCKIN’ BITCH!)
  
  
 Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times,
  
 I can't believe it,
 Ripped her heart out right before her eyes,
                  Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it
  
  
 (4/4)
    She was never this good in
 bed even when she was sleepin'
      Now she's just so perfect I've
    Never been quite so fucking deep in
                                   (*Strings play notes:   
          It goes on, and on, and on, I can keep you 
 lookin' young and preserved forever,
         With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
           'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
            Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
          And I know, I know it's not your time
            But bye, bye
        And a word to the wise when the fire dies
                 You think it's over but it's just begun
                   But baby don't cry
  
 You had my heart, at least for the most part
         'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, we fell apart
                Let's make a new start
         'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime yea-yeah
                 But baby don't cry-ay-ay-ay-ay
  
  
 [Verse 2] (6/4)
    New possibilities I'd never considered,
     Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard,
    Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave,
    To repossess a body with which I'd misbehaved
  
 Smiling right from ear to ear
 Almost laughed herself to tears
  
 Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times,
  
 I can't believe it,
 Ripped his heart out right before his eyes,
                  Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it
  
 (4/4)
    Now that it's done I 
      realize the error of my ways
    I must venture back to
        apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave
  
    I gotta make up for what I've done
         'cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
            While you burned in hell, no peace forever
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
           'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
            Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
          And I know, I know it's not your time
            But bye, bye
        And a word to the wise when the fire dies
                 You think it's over but it's just begun
                   But baby don't cry
  
 You had my heart, at least for the most part
         'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, we fell apart
                Let's make a new start
         'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime yea-yeah

 [Bridge 1]
      I    will suffer for so long    (What will you do, not long enough)
             To make it up to you   (I pray to God that you do)
              I'll do whatever you want me to do
                  (Well then I'll grant you one chance)
 And if  it's not enough   (If it's not enough, if it's not enough)
          If it's not enough (Not enough) Try again (Try again)
 And again (And again) Over and over again
  
 (5/4)
    We're coming back, coming back
    We'll live forever, live forever
    Let's have wedding, have a wedding
    Let's start the killing, start the killing
  
  
 [Enter Drums 2] (4/4)
  
  
 [Interlude 2]
    Do you take this man in death for the rest of your natural life?   (Yes, I do)
    Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your natural life?
           (I do)  I now pronounce you...
  
  
 [Chorus 3]
           'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
            Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs

                          This is how the story ends.
                  Too bad that you couldn't see,
                  See the man that boy could be.

                  I'll be at the studio, singing the song we wrote,
                             About a girl you used to know.
                  I'm with the skater boy, I said see ya later boy,

 [Verse]
  
                You know you love me, I know you care
               Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
            You want my love, you want my heart
            And we will never, ever, ever be apart
             Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
            We're just friends, what are you saying?
               Say there's another and look right in my eyes
         My first love broke my heart for the first time
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                  And I'm was like, baby, baby, baby no
            I'm like baby, baby, baby no
            I'm like baby, baby, baby no
      I thought you'd always be mine, mine
 Baby, baby, baby no

 [Verse]
  
     For you, I would have done whatever
            And I just can't believe we ain't together
            And I'm gotta play it cool, `cause I'm losing you
             I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
           `Cause I'm in pieces, baby fix me
        Just shake `til you wake me from this bad dream
        I'm goin' down, down, down
  
 And I just can't believe my first love won't be around
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
              And I'm like, baby, baby, baby no
            I'm like baby, baby, baby no
            I'm like baby, baby, baby no
      I thought you'd always be mine, mine
 Baby, baby, baby no
            I'm like baby, baby, baby no
            I'm like baby, baby, baby no

   You can give all of your love
                              But sometimes it won't be enough
                             Never told me this day would come

           If I had Wings, like Noah's Dove

             Life ain't worth living without the one you love

 [Intro]
 Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
      Sometimes I feel like giving up but I just can't
                 It isn't in my blood
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
   I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
    I could take to ease my mind slowly
                                    Just have a drink and you'll feel better
                                     Just take her home and you'll feel better
                               Keep telling me that it gets better, does it ever?
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
 Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
      Sometimes I feel like giving up, no medicine is strong enough
          Someone help me, I'm crawling in my skin
      Sometimes I feel like giving up but I just can't
                 It isn't in my blood
                 It isn't in my blood
  
  
 [Verse 2]
    I'm looking through my phone again, feeling anxious
    Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
    I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
                              Is there somebody who could help me, it's like the walls are caving in
      Sometimes I feel like giving up, no medicine is strong enough
          Someone help me, I'm crawling in my skin
      Sometimes I feel like giving up but I just can't
                 It isn't in my blood
                 It isn't in my blood

 I'm not afraid

          There's nothing you can throw at me

 [Verse 1]
  
    Sunday morning rain is falling
    Steal some covers share some skin
    Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
             You twist to fit the mold that I am in
            But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
                    And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
             That someday it would lead me back to you
             That someday it would lead me back to you
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
              That may be all I   need
                     In darkness she is all I   see
                     Come and rest your bones with  me
                         Driving slow on Sunday morning
        And I never want to leave
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
    Fingers trace your every outline
    Paint a picture with my hands
    Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
                   Change the weather still together when it ends
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
              That may be all I   need

 I could lift you up

       and take you where you want to be
  
 You could be my luck

     I know that we'll be safe and sound
  
 I could fill your cup
              You know my river won't evaporate

 You could be my luck

0,Rainbow Connection chords,Rainbow Connection – Kenny Loggins,"Why are there so many songs about rainbows,
 and what's on the other side?
 Rainbows are visions, but only illusions.
 Rainbows have nothing to hide.
 So we've been told and some choose to believe it.
 I know they're wrong, wait and see.
 Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.
 The lovers, the dreamers, and me.
  
 Who said that every wish would be heard and answered
 and wished on a morning star?
 Somebody thought of that and someone believed him.
 Look what it's done so far.
 What's so amazing and keeps us stargazing?
 What do we think we might see?
 Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.
 The lovers, the dreamers and me.
  
 Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
 I've heard them calling my name.
 Are these the sweet sounds that called the young sailors?
 I think they're one and the same.
 I've heard it too many times to ignore it.
 It's something that I'm supposed to be.
 Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection.
 The lovers, the dreamers and me.

 [Intro]   
  
 [Verse]
  
    Sir I'm a bit nervous about being here today,
   Still not quite sure what I'm going to say.
   So bare with me please if I take up too much of your time.
   See in this box is a ring for your oldest,
   She's my everything and all that I know is,
   It would be such a relief if I knew we were on the same side.
   'Cuz very soon I'm hoping that I,
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                    Can marry your daughter,
                    And make her my wife.
                I want her to be the only girl that I love for the rest of my life,
                  And give her the best of me till the day that I die.
 I'm gonna marry your princess and make her my queen.
                      She'll be the most beautiful bride that I've ever seen.
                  I can't wait to smile,
                          When she walks down the aisle,
                   On the arm of her father,
      On the day that I marry your daughter.
  
  
 [Verse]
  
    She's been here every step since the day that we met.
                Scared to death to think of what would happen if she ever left.
   So don't you ever worry about me ever treating her bad.
          I've got most of the vows done so far.
                   So bring on the better or worst, and till death do us part
            There's no doubt in my mind
 It's time I'm ready to start.
   I swear to you with all of my heart,
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                           I'm gonna marry your daughter,
                    And make her my wife.
                I want her to be the only girl that I love for the rest of my life,

   Lightning crashes..... a new mother cries
   Her placenta falls to the floor
       The angel opens her eyes.... The confusion sets in
   Before the doctor can even close the door
  
   Lightning crashes, an old mother dies
   Her intentions fall, to the floor
      The angel closes her eyes, the confusion that was hers
   Belongs now to the baby down the hall

                 Presents the circle, and puts the glory out to hide, hide

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
  I’m five years old 
                It’s getting cold 
              I’ve got my big coat on 
  I hear your laugh 
              And look up smiling at you 
    I run and run 
  Past the pumpkin patch 
                  And the tractor rides look now,
      The sky is gold 
  I hug your legs and fall asleep 
     On the way home
  
 [Chorus]
  I don’t know why all the trees change in the fall
  I know you’re not scared of anything at all 
  Don’t know if Snow White’s house is near or far away 
                       But I know I had the best day with you today 
  
 [Verse 2]
  I’m thirteen now
                 And don’t know how my friends 
        Could be so mean 
  I come home crying 
          And you hold me tight 
      And grab the keys 
  And we drive and drive 
               Until we found a town 
       Far enough away 
  And we talk and window-shop 
        'til I’ve forgotten all their names 
  
 [Chorus]
  I don’t know who I’m gonna talk to now at school 
  I know I’m laughing on the car ride home with you 
  Don’t know how long it’s gonna take to feel okay 
                       But I know I had the best day with you today 
  
 [Bridge]
  I have an excellent father 
  His strength is making me stronger 
  God smiles on my little brother 
  Inside and out he’s better than I am
  I grew up in a pretty house 
            And I had space to run 
      And I had the best days with you 
  There is a video 
    I found from back when I was three 
  You set up a paint set in the kitchen 
             And you’re talking to me 
  It’s the age of princesses and pirate ships 
          And the seven dwarves 
 And Daddy’s smart and you're the prettiest lady
         In the whole wide world 
  
 [Chorus]
  Now I know why all the trees change in the fall 
  I know you were on my side even when I was wrong 
        And I love you for giving me your eyes 
  Staying back and watching me shine 
     And I didn’t know if you knew 
         So I’m taking this chance to say 
                 That I had the best day with you today

 [Verse 1]
  
  All I can ever be to you, is a darkness that we knew,
      And this regret I got ac-customed to.
  
  Once it was so right, when we were at our high,
  Waiting for you in the ho-tel at night.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
           I knew I hadn't met my match, but every moment we could snatch.
    I don't know why I got so attached.
  
            It's my responsibility, and you don't owe nothing to me,
         But to walk away; I have no ca-pacity.
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
  
  He walks a-way; the sun goes down.
  He takes the day, but I'm grown.
         And in your grey, in this blue shade,
     My tears dry on their own.
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
  I don't understand; why do I stress a man,
       When there's so many better things at hand?
  
             We could a never had it all; we had to hit a wall,
     So this is in-evita-ble withdrawal.
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
          Even if I stop wanting you, a per-spective pushes through,
       I'll be some next man's other woman soon.
  
          I can't play myself again, I should just be my own best friend,
      Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men.
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
  
  He walks a-way; the sun goes down.
  He takes the day, but I'm grown.
         And in your grey, in this blue shade,
     My tears dry on their own.
  
  
 [Bridge 1]
  
     So we are history; your shadow covers me, the sky above, a blaze...
  
  
 [Chorus 3]
  
  He    walks away; the sun goes down.
  He takes the day, but I'm grown.
         And in your grey, in this blue shade, my tears dry on their own.
  
  
 [Verse 5]
  
    I wish I could say no regrets, and no e-motional debts,
       'Cos as we kiss good-bye the sun sets.
  
     So we are history; the shadow covers me,
      The sky above a blaze that only lovers see.
  
  
 [Chorus 4]
  
  He walks a-way; the sun goes down.
  He takes the day, but I'm grown.
         And in your grey, in this blue shade,
     My tears dry on their own.
  
  
 [Chorus 5]
  
  He walks a-way; the sun goes down.
  He takes the day, but I'm grown.
         And in your grey, in this blue shade,
     My tears dry on their own.
  
  
 [Chorus 6]
  
  He walks a-way; the sun goes down.
  He takes the day, but I'm grown.
         And in your grey, in this blue shade,
     My tears dry...

                  Every move you make,

 Since you've been gone, I've been lost without a trace,
 I dream at night I can only see your face,
 I look around but it's you I can't replace,
 I feel so cold and I long for your embrace,
 I keep crying baby, baby please.

      and he never gives an answer

      the man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
      but nobody ever hears him, or the sound he appears to make
      and he never seems to notice

 Atemlos
  
  
 [Verse 1]
 Wir ziehn durch die Straßen und die Clubs dieser Stadt,
 Das ist unsre Nacht, wie für uns gemacht, oho oho
 Ich schließe meine Augen, lösche jedes Tabu
 Küsse auf der Haut, so wie ein Liebes-Tattoo, oho, oho.
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
                   Was das zwischen uns auch ist, Bilder die man nie vergisst
                     Und dein Blick hat mir gezeigt, das ist unsre Zeit
  
  
 [Chorus]
 Atemlos durch die Nacht,
          Bis ein neuer Tag erwacht
  
 Atemlos einfach raus
        Deine Augen ziehen mich aus!
  
 Atemlos durch die Nacht
            Spür was Liebe mit uns macht
  
 Atemlos, schwindelfrei, 
         großes Kino für uns zwei
  
 Wir sind heute ewig, tausend Glücksgefühle
 Alles was ich bin, teil’ ich mit Dir
 Wir sind unzertrennlich, irgendwie unsterblich
 Komm nimm meine Hand und geh mit mir
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 Komm wir steigen auf das höchste Dach dieser Welt
 Halten einfach fest was uns zusammen hält, oho, oho
 Bist du richtig süchtig, Haut an Haut ganz berauscht,
 Fall in meine Arme und der Fallschirm geht auf, oho, oho.

 Atemlos durch die Nacht,

    I waited 'til I saw the sun
    I don't know why I didn't come
    I left you by the house of fun
    I don't know why I didn't come
    I don't know why I didn't come
  
    When I saw the break of day
    I wished that I could fly away
    Instead of kneeling in the sand
    Catching tear-drops in my hand

     My heart is drenched in wine
      But you'll be on my mind for-ev- er

    Out across the endless sea
    I will die in ecstasy
    But I'll be a bag of bones
    Driving down the road alone

 [Intro]
  
  
 Seven AM, the usual morning lineup
 Start on the chores and sweep 'til the floor's all clean
 Polish and wax, do laundry, and mop and shine up
         Sweep again, and by then it's like seven fifteen
  
  
              And so I'll read a book
           Or maybe two or three
             I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery
            I'll play guitar and knit
               And cook and basically
              Just wonder when will my life begin?
  
  
  
  
 Then after lunch it's puzzles and darts and baking
 Paper mache, a bit of ballet and chess
 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""A#"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">A#</span> Pottery and ventriloquy, candle making
            Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch, take a climb
        Sew a dress!
  
  
           And I'll re-read the books
            If I have time to spare
                 I'll paint the walls some more
                   I'm sure there's room somewhere
                And then I'll brush and brush
                And brush and brush my hair
               Stuck in the same place I've always been
  
  
                And I'll keep wanderin' and wanderin'
      And wanderin' and wonderin'
 When will my life begin?
  
  
 (Single strum entire last verse)
           Tomorrow night
      The lights will appear
 Just like they do on my birthday each year
 What is it like
 Out there where they glow?
 Now that I'm older
         Mother might just
         Let me go...
  
  
  
 Have fun and RATE:)

 [Verse 2]
  
   Faded pictures on the wall
                  It's like they talkin' to me
   Disconnectin' your call
              Your phone don't even ring
     I gotta get out
      Or figure this shit out
   It's too close for comfort
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 It's a thief in the night
             To come and grab you
 It can creep up inside you
         And consume you
 A disease of the mind
         It can control you
 I feel like a monster
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                  Throw on your brake lights
                We're in the city of wonder
                Ain't gonna play nice
                  Watch out, you might just go under
           Better think twice
                  Your train of thought will be altered
             So if you must falter, be wise
        Your mind's in disturbia
                 It's like the darkness is the light
      Disturbia
         Am I scaring you tonight
 N.C.                  (Your mind's in) disturbia
         Ain't used to what you like
      Disturbia
      Disturbia

 [Bridge]
  
   Release me from this curse
        I've been trying to maintain
             But I'm struggling
       You can't go, go, go
               I think I'm going to oh, oh, oh
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                  Throw on your brake lights

 Cemeteries of London
 ====================
  
 Capo 1
  
 At night they would go walking till the break in the day
 The morning is for sleeping
 Through the dark streets they go searching to see God in their own way
 Save the nighttime for you weeping
 Your weeping
  
          Singing la la la la la la lay
          And the night over London hey
  
        So we rode down to the river where the toiling ghosts spring
            For their curses to be broken
           We'll go underneath the arches where the witches are in the sea
            There are ghost towns in the ocean
      The ocean
  
  
          Singing la la la la la la lay
          And the night over London hey

              And all the cemeteries in London
        I see god come in my garden, but I don't know what he'd say
         For my heart it wasn't open
      Not open
  
  
          Singing la la la la la la lay
          And the night over London hey
          Singing la la la la la la lay
             There's no light over London today

 Lovers In Japan/Reign of Love
 =============================
  
  
 [Intro]
  
  
  
 Lovers, keep on the road you're on
 Runners, until the race is run
 Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
 Sometimes even right is wrong
  
           They are turning my head  out
     To see what I'm all about
             Keeping my head  down
     To see what it feels like now
        But I have no doubt
      One day, we are gonna get out
  
  
 Tonight maybe we're gonna run
 Dreaming of the Osaka sun
 Ohh ohh...
 Dreaming of when the morning comes
  
           They are turning my head  out
     To see what I'm all about
             Keeping my head  down
     To see what it feels like now
        But I have no doubt
      One day the sun will come out

 Reign of    love 
    I can’t let  go
 To the sea   I offer 
       This heavy   load 
  
  
 Locusts    will
 Lift me   up 
 I’m just a prisoner 
       In a reign of love 
  
  
  
  
 Locusts  will 
 Let us   stop 
 I wish I’d spoken 
         To the reign of love 
  
  
 Reign of    love 
         By the church, we’re waiting 
 Reign of    love 
     My knees go   praying 
  
 How I     wish 
      I’d spoken   up 
     Or we’d be carried 
         In the reign of love.

 Capo 1
  
  
 When it started we had high hopes
         Now my back's on the line
                   My back's on the ropes
  
 When it started we were alright
      But night makes a fool of us in the daylight
  
  
 Yeah we were dying of frustration
         saying Lord lead me not into temptation
  
 But it's not easy when she turns you on
    Since they gone
  
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 If you'll only, if you'll only say yes
              Whether you will's anybody's guess
 God, only God knows I'm trying my best 
          But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
  
  
 So, up they picked me by the big toe
        I was held from the rooftop then they let go
  
 There's only screaming let the windows down
            As I come to the ground
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 If you'll only, if you'll only say yes
              Whether you will's anybody's guess
 God, only God knows she won't let me rest
          But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
         I've become so tired of this loneliness

 ( I used to rule the world 
             Seas would rise when I gave the word 
                       Now in the morning I sweep alone 
            Sweep the streets I used to own
  
  
 ( I used to roll the dice 
            Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes 
                Listen as the crowd would sing: 
            ""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""
  
  
 ( One minute I held the key 
           Next the walls were closed on me 
                            And I discovered that my castles stand 
       Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand 
  
    I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
 Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
 Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
     My missionaries in a foreign field 
 For some reason I can't explain 
 Once you go there was never, never an honest word
           That was when I ruled the world 
  
  
 ( It was the wicked and wild wind 
                Blew down the doors to let me in. 
                            Shattered windows and the sound of drums 
         People couldn't believe what I'd become
  
 ( Revolutionaries wait 
          For my head on a silver plate 
                     Just a puppet on a lonely string
     Oh who would ever want to be king? 
  
  
    I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
 Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
 Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
     My missionaries in a foreign field 
 For some reason I can't explain 
    I know Saint Peter will call my name ,
     never an honest word

 [Verse]
  
        Was a long and dark December 
  
 From the rooftops I remember
            There was snow, white snow 
    Clearly I remember from the windows 
                              They were watching while we froze 
          Down below 
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
            When the future architecture 
       By a carnival of idiots on show 
                 You better lie low 
         If you love me, won’t you let me know 
  
  
 [Verse]
  
        Was a long and dark December 
 When the banks became cathedrals
          And the frost became gone 
   Creased cut stones and bibles 
 Are all out to fade their rifles
           And the cross was held aloft

          I don’t wanna be a soldier

              So, if you love me, why’d you let me go 
  
  
 [Outro]
  
            I took my love down to Violet Hill 
          There we sat    in    snow 
           All that time she was silenced still 
      So, if you love me, won’t you let  me   know?
 If you love me, won’t you let me know?

 [Verse 1]
 You say ""I love you, boy""
 I know you lie
 I trust you all the same
 I don't know why
  
 [Verse 2]
 'Cos when my back is turned
 My bruises shine
 Our broken fairytale
 So hard to hide
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 I still believe
 It's you and me to the end of time
  
 [Chorus]
 When we collide we come together
 If we don't we'll always be apart
 I'll take a bruise, I know you're worth it
 When you hit me, hit me hard
  
 [Verse 3]
 Sitting in a wishing hole
 Hoping it stays right
 Feet cast in solid stone
 I've got Gilligan's eyes
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 I still believe
 It's you and me to the end of time
  
 [Chorus]
 When we collide we come together
 If we don't we'll always be apart
 I'll take a bruise, I know you're worth it
 When you hit me, hit me hard
  
 [Bridge]
 'Cos you said our love
 Is letting us go, guess what
 Our future is for
 Many of horror
 Our future's for
 Many of horror

 I can't remember   anything
 Can't tell if this is true or dream
 Deep down inside I feel to scream
 This terrible silence stops me
  
 Now that the war is through with me
 I'm waking up, I cannot see
 That there is not much left of me
 Nothing is real but pain now
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   Hold my breath as I wish for death
        Oh please, God, wake me

 Back in the womb it's much too real
 In pumps life that I must feel
 But can't look forward to reveal
 Look to the time when I'll live
  
 Fed through the tube that sticks in me
 Just like a wartime novelty
 Tied to machines that make me be
 Cut this life off from me

        Oh please, God, wake me

 That's how I know you go on
 Far across the distance 
      And spaces between us
 You have come to show you go on

 Once more you open the door

         And my heart will go on and on

 And never let go 'til we're one

 Hi!  This can be played along with the actual song and it
 sounds really good :)
 I took the time & chorded the entire song all the way through
 BUT-**Credit for figuring out the chords in the first place
 goes to *Mealz* (version 2's tabber)**
 I changed a few here & there and put my take on where
 the chords are played.  I think it makes it much easier
 for beginners!    Have fun & RATE:)
  
  
  
 Standard tuning w/
 Capo on 3
  
  
  
 To the left, To the left 
 To the left, to the left
 To the left, to the left
 Everything you own in the box to the left
 In the closet that's my stuff - Yes
 If I bought it  please don't touch (don't touch)
 And keep talking that mess, that's fine
 But could you walk and talk at the same time and
 It's my mine name that is on that Jag
 So remove your bags let me call you a cab
  
  
  
 Standing in the front yard telling me
 How I'm such a fool - Talking about
 How I'll never ever find a man like you
                    You got me twisted
  
  
                                  You must not know about me, you must not know about me
               I could have another you in a minute
              Matter fact he'll be here in a minute - baby
                                  You must not know about me, you must not know about me
             I can have another you by tomorrow
               So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
  
  
  
 ( So go ahead and get gone
 Call up that chick and see if she's home
    Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
 What did you think I was putting you out for?
 ( Cause you was untrue 
 Rolling her around in the car that I bought youOO
                      Baby drop them keys hurry up before your taxi leaves
  
  
  
 Standing in the front yard telling me
 How I'm such a fool - Talking about
 How I'll never ever find a man like you
                   You got me twisted
  
  
                                  You must not know about me, you must not know about me
             I can have another you in a minute
              Matter fact he'll be here in a minute - baby
                                  You must not know about me, you must not know about me
              I will have another you by tomorrow
               So don't you ever for a second get to thinking..... 
                                   You're irreplaceable (irreplacable)
  
  
                        So since I'm not your everything
                    How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you (nothing)
       Baby I wont shed a tear for you (I wont shed a tear for you)
 I won't lose a wink of sleep (a wink of sleep)
 Cause the truth of the matter is... replacing you is so easy
  
  
  
                          To the left, To the left 
 To the left, to the left
 To the left, to the left
 Everything you own in the box to the left
 To the left, to the left
 Don't you ever for a second get to thinking...
                   You're irreplaceable
  
  
                                  You must not know about me, you must not know about me

              Matter fact he'll be here in a minute - baby

             I can have another you by tomorrow
               So don't you ever for a second get to thinking

               I could have another you in a minute
              Matter fact he'll be here in a minute 
               You can pack all your bags, were finished
             'Cause you made your bed now lay in it
               I could have another you by tomorrow
            Don't you ever for a second get to thinking 
                   You're irreplaceable

 [Verse]
  
 To this day when I hear that song, I see you standing there on that lawn
 Discount shades, store bought tan, flip-flops and cut off jeans
 Somewhere between that setting sun, I'm On Fire and Born To Run
 You looked at me and I was done but we were just getting started
  
 I was singing to you, you were singing to me
 I was so alive, never been more free
 Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang oh
  
 Stated there till the forced us out
 We took the long way to your house
 And I can still hear the sound
 Of you saying don't go
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 When I think about you
 I think about 17
 I think about my old Jeep
 I think about the stars in the sky
 Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
 Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
 Springsteen
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 If I bumped into you by happenstance
 You probably wouldn't even know who I am
 But if I whispered your name, I bet there'd still be a spark
 From back when I was gasoline and this old tattoo had brand new ink
 And we didn't care what your mom would think 'bout your name on my 
 arm
  
 Baby is it spring or is it summer
 The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
 You hear sometimes late at night on your radio
 Even though you're a million miles away
 When you hear Born In The USA
 You relive those glory days from so long ago
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 When I think about you
 I think about 17
 I think about my old Jeep
 I think about the stars in the sky
 Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
 Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
 Springsteen
  
  
 Whoah-oh-oh-oh

 [Verse 1]
   Loving and fighting
              Accusing, denying
           I can't imagine a world with you gone
                  The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of
            I'd be so lost if you left me alone
                 You locked yourself in the bathroom
               Lying on the floor when I break through
   I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
                             Can you hear me screaming ""please don't leave me""
  
 [Chorus]
   Hold on, I still want you
   Come back, I still need you
         Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
   I swear to love you all my life
   Hold on, I still need you
  
 [Verse 2]
   A long endless highway, you're silent beside me
            Drivin' a nightmare I can't escape from
             Helplessly praying, the light isn't fadin'
             Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
                 They took you away on a table
                  I pace back and forth as you lay still
   I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
                              Can you hear me screaming, ""please don't leave me""
  
 [Chorus]

 Give a little bit,   give a little bit of your love to me

 There's so much that we need to share
 Send a smile and show you care
  
 I'll give a little bit,   I'll give a little bit of my life for you
 So give a little bit,   give a little bit of your time to me
 See the man with the lonely eyes
      Oh, Take his hand, you'll be surprised
  
  
 Give a little bit,   give a little bit of your love to me
 Give a little bit,  I'll give a little bit of my life to you
 Now's the time that we need to share

 Moon has never glowed this color
 Hearts have never been this close
 I have never been more certain
 I will love you 'til we're old

 Stay together,

 Some might say that we should never ponder,

 [Verse]
  
 He was working thru college
 On my grampa's farm
 I was thirstin? for knowledge
 And he had a car
 I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
 One restless summer we found love growing wild
 On the banks of a river near a well beaten path
 Ain't it funny how those memories they last

 I still remember
 when thirty was old
 My biggest fear was September
 when he had to go

 we drifted away like the leaves in the fall

 EDIT:
 I didn't include the slash chord in some of this guitar chord chart below cause either;
 it's not very audible or you can't play the right octave and it'll sound bad... so
 * means bass note not included.
  
 Remember, these are the ways I like to play it and how I think the song voices it.. but
 interpretation is invited.
 The chords are also not that easy so, putting a capo on and transposing it may be easier. idk.

  I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
  I threw my phone across the room, at you
  I was expecting some dramatic turn away
      But yoooou       stayed
  
  
  
  This morning I said we should talk about it
 Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
 That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
           And said okay let's talk
      And I said...
  
  
  
 Stay, stay, stay
 I've been loving you for quite some 
 Time, time, time
 You think that it's funny when I'm 
 Mad, mad, mad
      But I think that it's best if we both stay
  
  
  
 Before you I'd only dated self indulgent takers 
      Who took all of their problems out on me
 But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
    I love you because you have given me no choice but to

 Tip for beginners or people who are just lazy diamonds like me:
 Transpose this tab down -3 to Em and then put on a capo 3rd fret
 to match the original key.

    Remember when you were young?
    You shone like the sun.
 Shine on you craaaazy  diamond.
 Now there's a look in your eyes,
    like black holes in the sky.
 Shine on you craaaazy  diamond.

           You were caught in the crossfire
     of childhood and stardom,
 Blown on the steel breeze.
 Come on you target for faraway laughter,
 Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine.

 Rode on the steel breeze.
 Come on you raver, you seer of visions,
 Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine.

 Take my hand, take a breath
 Pull me close and take one step
 Keep your eyes locked on mine,
 And let the music be your guide.

 Won't you promise me (now won't you promise me, that you'll never forget)
 We'll keep dancing (to keep dancing) wherever we go next
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 It's like catching lightning the chances of finding someone like you
 It's one in a million, the chances of feeling the way we do
 And with every step together, we just keep on getting better
 So can I have this dance (can I have this dance)
 Can I have this dance

 Take my hand, I'll take the lead
 And every turn will be safe with me
 Don't be afraid, afraid to fall
 You know I'll catch you threw it all

     We sailed on together we drifted apart and here you are by my side
  
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 So now I come to you with open     arms Nothing to hide believe what I say
     So here I am with open     arms Hoping you'll see what your love means
               to me   Open arms
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Living without you, Living alone, This empty house seems so cold
 Wanting to Hold You, Wanting you near, How much I wanted you home
      But now that you've come back, turned night into day  I need you to say
  
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 So now I come to you with open     arms Nothing to hide believe what I say
     So here I am with open     arms Hoping you'll see what your love means
               to me   Open arms

 [Verse]
         I have often dreamed, of a far off place
           Where a hero’s welcome, would be waiting for me
               Where the crowds will cheer, when they see my face
         And a voice keeps saying, this is where I’m meant to be
  
  
 [Chorus]
            I’ll be there someday, I can go the distance
          I will find my way, if I can be strong
          I know every mile, will be worth my while
          When I go the distance, I’ll be right where I belong
  
  
 [Verse]
          Down an unknown road, to embrace my fate
                Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
          And a thousand years, would be worth the wait
            It might take a lifetime, but somehow I’ll see it through
  
  
 [Chorus]
         And I won’t look back, I can go the distance
             And I’ll stay on track, no, I won’t accept defeat
           It’s an uphill slope, but I won’t lose hope
          Till I go the distance, and my journey is complete

          But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part

 Spread the love people! Same love!
  
  
 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 When I was in the third grade I thought I was gay
             'Cause I could draw, an' my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
 I told my mom tears rushing down my face
              She's like ""Ben you've loved girls since before pre-k,"" trippin'
 Yea I guess she had a point didn't she?
 Bunch of stereotypes all in my head.
 I remember doing the math like, ""yea I'm good at little league""
 A preconceived idea of what it all meant
  
 (repeat progression)
  
 For those that liked the same sex
 Had the characteristics
 The right wing conservatives think it's a decision
 And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
 Man made rewiring of a predisposition
 Playing god, aw nah here we go
 America the brave still fears what we don't know
 And god loves all his children, is somehow forgotten
 But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five-hundred years ago
 I don't know
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And I can't change
             Even if I tried
             Even if I wanted to
               And I can't change
 Even if I tried
 Even if I wanted to
 My love, my love, my love
                She keeps me warm
                She keeps me warm
                She keeps me warm
                She keeps me warm
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
 Have you read the YouTube comments lately
 ""Man, that's gay"" get dropped on the daily
 We become so numb to what we're saying
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
              Our culture founded from oppression, yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
 Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
 A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
 'Gay' is synonymous with the lesser
            It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
 Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
  
 (repeat progression)
  
 The same fight that led people to walk outs and sit ins
 It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference!
 Live on and be yourself
 When I was at church they taught me something else
 If you preach hate at the service those words aren't anointed
 That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
                 When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
               Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
 I might not be the same, but that's not important
      No freedom till we're equal, damn right I support it
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 (repeat instrumental progression)
  
 And I can't change
 Even if I tried
 Even if I wanted to
 My love
 My love
 My love
 She keeps me warm
 She keeps me warm
 She keeps me warm
 She keeps me warm
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 And press play, don't press pause
 Progress, march on
                         With the veil over our eyes
              We turn the back on the cause
            Till the day that my uncles can be united by law
  
 When kids are walking 'round the hallway plagued by pain in their heart
 A world so hateful some would rather die than be who they are
 And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
 But it's a damn good place to start
 No law is gonna change us
 We have to change us
 Whatever god we believe in
 We come from the same one

 [Verse 1]
   This old man and me
   Were at the bar and we
    Were having us some beers and
   Swapping I don't cares
   Talking politics
   Blonde and red-haired chicks
    Old dogs and new tricks and
   Habits we ain't kicked
   We talked about God's grace
   And all the hell we raised
    Then I heard the ol' man say
  
 [Chorus]
   God is great
            Beer is good
                   And people are crazy
  
 [Verse 2]
   He said ""I fought two wars
   Been married and divorced""
    What brings you to Ohio?
   He said ""Damned if I know""
   We talked an hour or two
   'Bout every girl we knew
    What all we put 'em through
   Like two old boys will do
   We pondered life and death
   He lit a cigarette
    Said ""These damn things'll kill me yet""
  
 [Chorus]
   But God is great
            Beer is good
                   And people are crazy
  
 [Bridge]
   Last call is 2 a.m
    I said goodbye to him
    I never talked to him again
  
 [Verse 3]
   Then one sunny day
   I saw the old man's face
    Front page obituary
   He was a millionaire-y
   He left his fortune to
   Some guy he barely knew
    His kids were mad as hell
   But me, I'm doing well
   And I dropped by today
   To just say thanks and pray
    And I left a six-pack right there on his grave
  
 And I said
  
 [Chorus]
   God is great
            Beer is good
                   And people are crazy
   God is great
            Beer is good
                   And people are crazy
   God is great
            Beer is good
                   And people are crazy

 this is exactly the same as the original except all the chords
 have been moved up a semitone, so that none of the chords
 specifically have to be barred. if you want you can tune your
 guitar down half a step to acheive the sound on the record.
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 Elope with me Miss Private and we’ll sail around the world
 I will be your Ferdinand and you my wayward girl
       How many nights of talking in hotel rooms can you take?
       How many nights of limping round on pagan holidays?
        Oh elope with me in private and we’ll set something ablaze
     A trail for the devil to erase
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 San Francisco’s calling us, the Giants and Mets will play
 Piazza, New York catcher, are you straight or are you gay?
     We hung about the stadium, we’ve got no place to stay
     We hung about the tenderloin and tenderly you tell
            About the saddest book you ever read, it always makes you cry
      The statue’s crying too and well he may
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
    I love you I’ve a drowning grip on your adoring face
    I love you my responsibility has found a place 
    Beside you and strong warnings in the guise of gentle words
       Come wave upon me from the family wider net absurd
               “You’ll take care of her, I know it, you will do a better job”
 Maybe, but not what she deserves
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
    Elope with me Miss Private and we’ll drink ourselves awake
        We’ll taste the coffee houses and award certificates
    A privy seal to keep the feel of 1960 style
        We’ll comment on the decor and we’ll help the passer by
         And at dusk when work is over we’ll continue the debate
       In a borrowed bedroom virginal and spare
  
  
 [Verse 5]
  
      The catcher hits for .318 and catches every day
      The pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidays
     He goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floor
     He knows the drink affects his speed he’s praying for 
 A doorway
         Back into the life he wants and the confession of the bench
 Life outside the diamond is a wrench
  
  
 [Verse 6]
  
    I wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekend
    I know it wouldn’t come to love, my heroine pretend
    A lady stepping from the songs we love until this day
        You’d settle for an epitaph like “Walk Away, Renee”
            The sun upon the roof in winter will draw you out like 
 A flower
  
 Meet you at the statue in an hour
 Meet you at the statue in an hour

   Oh!!
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
   But how do you expect me to live alone with just me? 'Cause my world
               revolves around you, it's so hard for me to breathe.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air?
                                     Can't live, can't breathe with no air
                                      It's how I feel whenever you ain't there
                   It's no air, no air
   Got me out here in the water, so deep
                                       Tell me, how you gon' breathe without me?
                                  If you ain't here I just can't breathe
                   It's no air, no air

 [Verse]
  
 (plucked)
  
   There’s a song that’s inside of my soul,
   It’s the one that I’ve tried to write over and over again.
   I’m awake in the infinite cold,
   But you sing to me over and over and over again. 
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 (strummed)
  
           So I lay my head back down,
            And I lift my hands and
      Pray to be only yours,
        I pray to be only yours,
         I know now you’re my only hope.

   Sing to me the songs of the stars,
   Of your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again.
   When it feels like my dreams are so far,
   Sing to me of the plans that you have for me over again.

   I’ll give you my apathy,
   I’m giving you all of me.
   I want your symphony,
      Singing in all that I am.
             At the top of my lungs,
          I’m giving it back.

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 You make it look like it's magic
 Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
 I'm never confused
 Hey, hey
 I'm so used to being used
 So I love when you call unexpected
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Cause I hate when the moment's expected
                   So I'ma care for you, you, you
                 I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
                    Cause girl you're perfect
                You're always worth it
          And you deserve it
              The way you work it
                 Cause girl you earned it
           Girl you earned it
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 You know our love would be tragic
 So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind
                   We live with no lies
 Hey, hey
 You're my favorite kind of night
 So I love when you call unexpected
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Cause I hate when the moment's expected
                   So I'ma care for you, you, you
                 I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
                    Cause girl you're perfect

          And you deserve it

                 Cause girl you earned it
           Girl you earned it
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 On that lonely night
 You said it wouldn't be love
 But we felt the rush
 It made us believe it there was only us
 Convinced we were broken inside, inside
  
  
 [Outro]
  
 Cause girl you're perfect
 You're always worth it
 And you deserve it
 The way you work it
 Cause girl you earned it
 Girl you earned it
