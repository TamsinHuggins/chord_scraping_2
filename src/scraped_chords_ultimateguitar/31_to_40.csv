 [Verse 1]
   I don't want a friend (just me)

 When you gotta run

 You say you want your story to remain untold

    A river in a time of dryness
    A harbour in the tempest

       Your love not to grow cold

 [Verse]
      Matagal tagal din nawalan ng gana
       Pinagmamasadan ang dumaraan
        Lagi nalang matigas ang loob
  
     Sabik na may maramdaman
  
     Di ka man bago sa paningin
     Palihim kang nasa yakap ko't lambing
     Sa bawat pagtago
       Di mapigilan ang bigkas ng
 damdamin

 [Verse]
       Kung may darating man ang umaga
        Gusto kita sana muling marinig (marinig)
    Ngiti mo lang ang nakikita ko
    Tauhin man ang silid
  
     Walang papantay sayo
     Maging sino man sila
     Ikaw ang araw sa tag-ulan
                  At sa maulap kong umaga

 pana-panahon ang pagkakataon 
 maibabalik ba ang kahapon? 
 natatandaan mo pa ba, 
 nang tayong dalwa ang unang nagkita?
 panahon ng kamusmusan
 sa piling ng mga bulaklak at halaman
 doon tayong nagsimulang
 mangarap at tumula

  malayang tulad ng mga ibon
  ang gunita ng ating kahapon
    ang mga puno't halaman
  ay kabiyak ng ating gunita
  sa paglipas ng panahon bakit kailangan ding lumisan?

 [Verse 1]
  Not a word    from your lips
 You just took for granted that I want to skinny dip
  A quick hit,  that's your game
 But I'm not a piece of meat, stimulate my brain
  The night is young,   so are we
 Let's just get to know each other slow and easily
  Take my hand, let's  hit the floor 
 Shake our bodies to the music maybe then you'll score

 A man wants to be approached cool and romantically

 [Verse]
  
                   I remember the times we spent together on those drives
           We had a million questions all about our lives
               and when we got to New York everything felt right
     I wish you were here with me
           tonight
  
                   I remember the days we spent together were not enough
                   and it used to feel like dreamin' except we always woke up
                     Never thought not having you here now would hurt so much
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
       Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
                I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
              And every night I miss you I can just look up
                 and know the stars are holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
         tonight
  
  
 [Verse]
  
                  I remember the time you told me about when you were eight
                  And all those things you said that night that just couldn't wait
                  I remember the car you were last seen in and the games we would play
                      All the times we spilled our coffees and stayed out way too late
                  I remember the time you sat and told me about your Jesus
               and how not to look back even if no one believes us
            When it hurt so bad sometimes not having you here...

       Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up

 [Verse 1]
           From the day we arrive on the planet
        And blinking, step into the sun
           There's more to be seen than can ever be seen
           More to do than can ever be done
  
 Some say eat or be eaten
          Some say live and let live
      But all are agreed as they join the stampede
            You should never take more than you give
  
  
 [Chorus]
                   In the circle of life
                     It's the wheel of fortune
                    It's the leap of faith
                   It's the band of hope
                   Till we find our place
                On the path unwinding
           In the cir - cle, the circle of li - fe
  
  
 [Verse 2]
    Some of us fall by the wayside
       And some of us soar to the stars
       And some of us sail through our troubles
        And some have to live with the scars
           There's far too much to take in here
           More to find than can ever be found
           But the Sun rolling high through the sapphire sky
                    Keeps great and small on the endless round

 [Verse 1]
   Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
   Whose love is mighty and so much stronger

   Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
   And leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
   The King of Glory,  the King above all kings

   The King of Glory,  the King above all kings

 [Verse]
  
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
          I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
         In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.
  
            Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,
    Vanished from my hand,
            Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
     My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
    I have no one to meet
           And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
          I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.

         In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,
     My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
     My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
        To be wanderin'.
      I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
    Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
                  I promise to go under it.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
          I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.

         In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.
  
  
 [Verse]
  
             Though you might hear laughin', spinnin', swingin' madly across the sun,
           It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
                  And but for the sky there are no fences facin'.
      And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
     To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
     I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're seein'
            That he's chasing.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
          I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.

       Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,
           Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
      The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
      Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
          Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
       Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
           With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
            Let me forget about today until tomorrow.

 NOTES:
 1. Since this was TAB'ed I learnt of the existence of 'The Wrecking Crew'.  Their musical contribution is
 unmistakable.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVUBpzlELOg; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCTVcNsJGX0
 2. My apologies to the UG players, as this TAB had been re-edited without my knowledge.  I have
 returned it to a corrected and playable format.  I trust that, you may continue to enjoy it? Ditto #2.
 3. ""...AllMusic calls the compilation ""a fascinating, educational listen, even if it's not
 necessarily indispensable.""[8] Q gave the ""enlightening"" box set a perfect score and wrote
 that ""the backing music tracks sans vocals opens your ears to a bevy of awe-inspiring nuances
 previously obscured by singing.  At the same time, the isolated vocal tracks are
 nothing less than spiritual in their emotive wallop. ...""
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pet_Sounds_Sessions
 4.  ""...The new mixes created for the box set were made in January–February 1996.
 Linett wrote: ""In mixing Pet Sounds in stereo, every attempt was made to duplicate the feel and
 sound of the original mono mixes. Vocal and instrumental parts that Brian left off the record
 in 1966 were noted and duplicated, as were the fades.  To this end, a Scully model 280 4-track
 was used to transfer the analog reels to digital multi-tracks – the same model used for
 'Pet Sounds'.  The mix was then processed through an original tube console from United Western
 Recorders in the 1960's. ...""  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pet_Sounds_Sessions

 [Verse 1]
  
 My head is stuck in the clouds
 She begs me to come down
       Says ""Boy quit foolin' around""
 I told her ""I love the view from up here
 The warm sun and wind in my ear
        We'll watch the world from above
        As it turns to the rhythm of love""

 [Verse 2]
  
 My heart beats like a drum
 A guitar string to the strum
    A beautiful song to be sung
 She's got, blue eyes deep like the sea
 That roll back when she's laughing at me
      She rises up like the tide
      The moment her lips meet mine

         We may only have tonight
               But till the morning sun you're mine , all mine

 When the moon is low
 We can dance in slow motion
 And all your tears will subside
 All your tears.......will dry
  
   Bah-bah-(ba-ba) bah bah – Bah-bah-(ba-ba)- Bah bah
 Daaah – dada,  dum - da da, Dum
   Bah-bah-(ba-ba) bah bah – Bah-bah-(ba-ba)- Bah bah
 Daaah – dada,  dum - da da, Dum
  
 And long after I've gone
 You'll still be humming along
      And I will keep you in my mind
       The way you make love so fine
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
         We may only have tonight
               But till the morning sun you're mine, all mine

 Ohh
 Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love

 Great song, Great band
  
 The chords are pretty much the same throughout but I would like to say
 that although ive said the 3rd chord in the progression is (F#m) and this is how I
 play it, sometimes it looks as though the guitar is playing a normal F# though its
 still sung as if over a minor. :) Enjoy

 [Verse 1]
  
 I was left to my own devices
 Many days fell away with nothing to show
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 And the walls kept tumbling down
                     In the city that we loved
 Great clouds roll over the hills
                         Bringing darkness from Above
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                        But if you close your eyes,
          Does it almost feel like
 Nothing changed at all?
                        And if you close your eyes,
          Does it almost feel like
 You've been here before?
 How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
 How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
 In your pose as the dust settles around us
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 And the walls kept tumbling down
                      In the city that we loved
 Great clouds roll over the hills
                         Bringing darkness from Above
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                        But if you close your eyes,
          Does it almost feel like
 Nothing changed at all?
                        And if you close your eyes,
          Does it almost feel like

 Do you have the time
 To listen to me whine
 About nothing and everything all at once
 I am one of those
 Melodramatic fools
 Neurotic to the bone no doubt about it

 Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
 It all keeps adding up

 To analyze my dreams
 She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
 I went to a whore
 He said my life is a bore
 And quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down

 From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
  Your steps keep me awake

 [Verse 1]
  
 When i was younger i saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind.
    He broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to re-assemble it.
      And my mamma swore she would never let herself forget.
      And that was the day that i promised I'd never sing of love if it does not
 exist. But darling..

    Maybe i know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts.
      And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face.
      And i've always lived like this keeping a comfortable, distance.
    And up until now I have swored to myself that I'm content with loneliness,
         Because none of it was ever worth the risk.

           Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream.

 Lady, where has your love gone?
        I was looking but can't find it anywhere
 They always offer when there's loads of love around
                   But, when you're short of some it's nowhere to be found
  
  
 Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday
 No chance, you'll get nothin' from me
           But now she's there, you're there, everybody's there
          He's in turmoil, as puzzled as can be
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
          Just like me
          Lets go down, down, low down
            Where I know I should not go
         Oh and she thinks she's the one
                 But she's just one in 24
                 And just cause everybody's doin' it
             Does that mean that I can, too?
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Lady, where has your love gone?
      He was the antiseptic to the sore
 To hold you by the hand must be first be in demand
          How he longs for you to long for him once more
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
             Just once more
          Lets go down, down, low down
            Where I know I should not go
         Oh and she thinks she's the one
                 But she's just one in 24
                 And just cause everybody's doin' it
             Does that mean that I can, too?
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 Her eyes went down and cut you up
                And there's nothing like a dirty look from
 The one you want, or the one you've lost
  
  
 [Outro]
  
 An ache in your soul is everybody's goal
     To get what they can't have
              That's why your after her and that's why she's after him
      But saying it won't change a thing
  
 And they'll realize that it won't change a thing
 Realizing it won't change a thing.

 Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
      and think of you
 Caught up in circles confusion,
     is nothing new
 Flashback warm nights;
    almost left behind
 Suitcase of memories,
       time after . .  
  
 Sometimes you picture me, 
      I'm walking too far ahead
 You're calling to me, I can't hear,
       what you ve said 
       Then you say go slow; 
    I fall behind 
      The second hand unwinds
  
            If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
 time after time
         If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting;
 time after time
            If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
 time after time
         If you fall I will catch you I will be waiting; 
 time after time
  
  
 After my picture fades and darkness has, 
 turned to gray
 Watching through windows you're wondering,
     if I'm OK
 Secrets stolen from deep inside;
      the drum beats out of time 
  
            If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
 time after time
         If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting;
 time after time

      The second hand unwinds

 Got to keep the loonies on the path.

 It's not a secret I try to hide
 I know you want me

 You claim it's not in the cards
                           But fate is pulling you miles away
                        And out of reach from me

 That you're my destiny?

               Say you were made to be mine
                Nothing could keep us apart

       On my own, pretending he's beside me,
      All alone, I walk with him till morning,
     Without him, I feel his arms around me,
      And when I lose my way I close my eyes and he has found me.

           All the lights are misty in the river,

          Still I say there's a way for us.

    I love him, but when the night is over,
        He is gone, the river's just a river,
    Without him the world around me changes,
      The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers.
  
    I love him, but every day I'm learning,
        All my life I've only been pretending,
    Without me his world will go on turning,
      A world that's full of happiness that I have never known.

 Capo: 1
  
 [Verse 1]
 (Turn around) Every now and then I get a little bit lonely, and you're never coming round
 (Turn around) Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
 (Turn around) Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all 
 the years have gone by
 (Turn around) Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes
 (Turn around, Bright eyes) Every now and the I fall apart
 (Turn around, Bright eyes) Every now and the I fall apart
  
 [Chorus]
        And I need you now, tonight, and I need you more than ever
             And if you only hold me tight we'll be holding on forever
            And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never be wrong
    Together we can take it to the end of the line
       Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
    I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
        We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
                       I really need you tonight, forever's gonna start tonight
     Forever's gonna start tonight
  
 Once upon a time I was falling in love but now I'm only falling apart
          There's nothing I can do, a total eclipse of the heart
 Once upon a time there was light in my life but now there's only love in the dark
 Nothing I can say, a total eclipse of the heart

 Of what they think You're like
 But, I've heard the tender whisper
 Of love in the dead of night

           And that I'm never alone

 [Verse 1]
  
              There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes
             In a happy home, I was a king I had a golden throne               
                 Those days are gone, now the memories are on the wall
             I hear the songs from the places where I was born
  
 Up on the hill, across the blue lake,
                                    That's where I had my first heartbreak
                              I still remember how it all changed
 My father said
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Don't you worry, don't you worry child
 See heaven's got a plan for you
 Don't you worry, don't you worry now
 Yeah!
  
 Don't you worry, don't you worry child
 See heaven's got a plan for you
 Don't you worry, don't you worry now
 Yeah!
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 (silence)    There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
               We ruled the world, I thought I'll never lose her out of sight,
             We were so young, I think of her now and then
                   I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend
  
 Up on the hill, across the blue lake,
                                    That's where I had my first heartbreak
                              I still remember how it all changed

 [Verse 1]
 You don't know babe
 When you hold me
 And kiss me slowly
           It's the sweetest thing
 And it don't change
 If I had it my way
 You would know that you are
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 You're the coffee that I need in the morning
 You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
 Won't you give yourself to me
          Give it all, oh

                 I just wanna see how beautiful you are
 You know that I see it
                   I know you're a star
                 Where you go I follow
  
 No matter how far
 If life is a movie
                        Oh you're the best part, oh
                  You're the best part, oh
 Best part

 It's the sunrise
 And those brown eyes
 You're the one that I desire
 When we wake up
 And then we make love
 It makes me feel so nice

 You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
 You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
 You're the sunshine on my life

 I just wanna see how beautiful you are
 You know that I see it
                   I know you're a star

 [Intro]
  
  
  
  
 Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
 Counting my footsteps praying the floor won't fall through again
          And my mother accused me of losing my mind
 But I swore I was fine
  
 You paint me a blue sky and go back and turn it to rain
          And I lived in your chess game
                              But you changed the rules everyday
 Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone
  
 Tonight
          Well I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
        Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
                             Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
 The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
              I should've known
  
  
 [Verse]
  
        Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
                Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
         And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
                And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
          Run as fast as you can
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
        Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
                            Don't you think I was too young to be messed with 
        The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
        Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
                            Don't you think 19's too young to be played by
        Your dark twisted games when I loved you so
               I should've known
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
             You are an expert at sorry
       And keeping lines blurry
 Never impressed by me acing your tests
          All the girls that you've run dry
        Have tired, lifeless eyes
             Cause you burned them out
         But I took your matches before fire could catch me
      So don't look now
       I'm shining like fireworks
 Over your sad empty town

 Wake up Maggie I think I've got something to say to you
       It's late September and I really should be back at school
    I know I keep you amused But I feel I'm being used
     Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
      You led me away from home just to save you from being alone
      You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
      The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
      But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything
    I laughed at all your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax
     Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
          You led me away from home just to save you from being alone
      You stole my soul that's a pain I can do without
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
          But you turned into a lover and mother what a lover you wore me out
 All you did was wreck my bed And in the morning kick me in the head
     Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
      You led me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone
      You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried

 I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
     Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
     Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand
     Oh Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
             You made a first class fool out of me, but I'm as blind as a fool can be
      You stole my heart but I love you anyway

 [Verse 1]
 Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
 Drifting throught the wind
 Wanting to start again
  
 Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
 Like a house of cards
 One blow from caving in
  
 Do you ever feel already buried deep
 Six feet under scream
 But no one seems to hear a thing
  
 Do you know that there's still a chance for you
 Cause there's a spark in you
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 You just gotta ignite the light
 And let it shine
 Just own the night
 Like the Fourth of July

 [Verse 2]
 You don't have to feel like a waste of space
 You're original, cannot be replaced
 If you only knew what the future holds
 After a hurricane comes a rainbow
  
 Maybe you're reason why all the doors are closed
 So you can open one that leads you to the perfect road
 Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow
 And when it's time, you'll know

 And let it shine
 Just own the night

 Working for her man,
  
 she brings home her pay

 UPDATE: I've made the chords line up a bit better with the words - and added an
 Em in place of a G in the ""I could live without you"" bit, (but both sound fine to be
 honest) and a chord chart.
  
 Also as a few people have asked about strumming / picking patterns, I have uploaded a
 video of my playing this:

 [Verse]
 Katie don't cry I know you're trying your hardest
                  And the hardest part is letting go  Of the nights we shared
   Ocala is calling and you know it's haunting
         but compared to your eyes
          nothing shines quite as bright
              And when we looked to the sky
           It's not mine but I want it.    So...
  
  
 [Chorus]
   Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
     (I know he's there and)
   You're probably hanging out and making eyes
  
 (While across the room he stares)
  I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
      And ask my girl to dance she'll say yes
                 (Because these words were never easier for me to say or
 Her to second-guess but I guess)
      That I can live without you but
   (Without I'll be miserable at best)

                            Is everything you couldn't take
                            Cause nothing feels like home
                          You're a thousand miles away
                           And the hardest part of living
                            Is just taking breaths to stay
                            Cause I know I'm good for something

 Voices singing let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly
 Rocking around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday
 Everyone dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way

 exist. But darling...

      And i've always lived like this keeping a comfortable, distance.

 [Verse]
  
  In the suburbs, I    I learned to drive
            And you told me we’d never survive, grab your mother’s keys, we’re leaving
  
  You always seemed so sure, that one day we’d be fighting
  In a suburban war, your part of town against mine
              I saw you standing on the opposite shore, but by the time the first bombs fell
    We were already bored, we were already, already bored

        The kids wanna be so hard, but in my dreams we’re still screaming
        And running through the yard, when all of the walls that they built
           In the seventies finally fall, and all of the houses they built
           In the seventies finally fall, meant nothing at all, meant nothing at all, it meant nothing

  So can you understand,    why I want a daughter 
                    While I’m still young, I wanna hold her hand and show her some beauty
      Before all this damage is done, but if it’s too much to ask
            If it’s too much to ask, then send me a son
  Under the overpass,   in the parking lot we’re still waiting
         It’s already passed,   so move your feet from hot pavement
        And into the grass,  'cause it’s already past, it’s already, already past
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
  Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
  Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling

 [Verse]
  
       When the days are cold
          And the cards all fold
         And the saints we see
          Are all made of gold
  
           When your dreams all fail
         And the ones we hail
         Are the worst of all
          And the blood's run stale
  
                        I want to hide the truth
                    I want to shelter you
                     But with the beast inside
                        There's nowhere we can hide
  
                    No matter what we breed
                       We still are made of greed
                     This is my kingdom come
                     This is my kingdom come
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                  When you feel my heat
              Look into my eyes
                       It's where my demons hide
                       It's where my demons hide
                Don't get too close
           It's dark inside

 [Verse]
  
 N.C.
 When the curtain's call
         Is the last of all
          When the lights fade out
          All the sinners crawl
  
          So they dug your grave
          And the masquerade
            Will come calling out
         At the mess you made
  
 Don't want to let you down
                But I am hell bound
                         Though this is all for you
                         Don't want to hide the truth
  
                    No matter what we breed
                       We still are made of greed

                   I say it's up to fate
                   It's woven in my soul
                    I need to let you go
  
                           Your eyes, they shine so bright
                       I want to save that light
                      I can't escape this now
                    Unless you show me how

 I've seen other tab interpretations of this song and I'm a bit perturbed at what
 seems to be some very tone deaf people out there. Not to say I am anywhere near
 perfect in my interpretation but this seems to work just fine playing in a jam
 session. (Note, Mr ""other people are tone deaf""'s tab has now been corrected.)

 *   Alternate the B7(Open E) and the B7 in the verse.
 **  When playing Em in the bridge, you can alternate the chord by holding B string
 (3rd Fret) and high E string (3rd fret) back and forth.
 *** I am well aware the last line of the bridge has a variance on the C to D. I
 found this the easiest way to play it however.

 [Verse 1]
     Share my life, take me for what I am
           Because I'll never change all my colors for you
   Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
        Just all that you are and everything that you do
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 I don't really need to look very much further
 I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
 I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
        Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
  
 [Chorus]
                     But don't make me close one more door
                I don't wanna hurt anymore
 Stay in my arms if you dare
               Or must I imagine you there
 Don't walk away from me
          I have nothing, nothing, nothing
         If I don't have you, you, you, you, you
  
 [Verse 2]

 [Verse]
  
 Well, when you told me you were drowning...
 I would not lend a hand...
 I've seen your face before my friend...
 But I don't know if you know who I am...
 But I was there and I saw what you did..
 Saw it with my own two eyes...
 So you can wipe off that grin...I know where you've been...
 It's all been a pack of lies...
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 I can feel it coming in the air tonight...oh lord...
 I've been waiting for this moment..for all my life..oh lord...
 I can feel it coming in the air tonight...oh lord...
      Oh lord...
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Well, I remember...
  
 I remember, don't worry...
 How could I ever forget?
            It's the first time...and the last time we ever met...
 But I know the reason why you keep this silence up...
  
 No, you don't fool me...
 For the hurt doesn't show...
  
 But the pain still grows..
         Some stranger to you and me...
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 I can feel it coming in the air tonight...oh lord...
 I've been waiting for this moment..for all my life..oh lord...
 I can feel it coming in the air tonight...oh lord...
  
 I can feel it coming in the air tonight...oh lord...
 I've been waiting for this moment..for all my life..oh lord...
 I can feel it coming in the air tonight...oh lord...
  
 I can feel it coming in the air tonight...oh lord...
 I've been waiting for this moment..for all my life..oh lord...
 I can feel it coming in the air tonight...oh lord...

 [Verse]
       Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
           You been out ridin' fences for so long now
               Oh, you're a hard one, I know that you got your reasons,
        These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow
  
 [Chorus]
            Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy,
         She'll beat you if she's able,
               You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
         Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
          But you only want the ones you can't get
  
 [Verse]
       Desperado, oh you ain't gettin' no younger,
       Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
      And freedom, well, that's just some people talkin'
       Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone
  
 [Chorus]
             Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
      The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
       It's hard to tell the night time from the day
         You're losin' all your highs and lows
           Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away
  
 [Verse]
       Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
       Come down from your fences, open the gate
            It may be rainin',  but there's a rainbow above you
             You better let somebody love you,
             You better let somebody love you before it's too late

          Just an ordinary song

           Tired of all the games you play
          When the world seems so unfair
          You can count on me to stay
       Just take sometime
       And lend an ear
          To this ordinary song

 [Verse 1]
               Well it's a marvelous night for a moondance with the 
    Stars up above in your eyes
        A fantabulous night to make romance 'neath the 
   Color of October skies
           All the leaves on the trees are   falling to the
 Sounds of the breezes that blow
           And i'm trying to place to the calling of your 
   Heartstrings that play soft and low
                You know the night’s magic seems to 
 Whisper and hush …you know the
 So   ft moonlight seems to shine
                In your blush
  
  
 [Chorus]
      Can I just have one more moon dance with 
   You........my love
      Can I just make some more romance with 
   You.........my love
  
  
 [Verse 2]
           Well I want to make love to you tonight
           I can't wait til the morning has come
         And I know now the time is just right
               And straight into my arms you will run
            When you come my heart will be waiting 
           To make sure that you're never alone
             There and then all my dreams will come true dear
             There and then I will make you my own
            And everytime I touch you, you just 
    Tremble inside 
               Then I know how much you want me, that
                 You can’t hide
  
  
 [Chorus]
      Can I just have one more moon dance with 
   You........my love
      Can I just make some more romance with 
   You.........my love

0,Hey Ya Acoustic chords,Hey Ya – Obadiah Parker,"Obadiah does a very simple rhythm to this version and it's not very hard to follow along.
 That being said he does the ""Shake it up"" part a different amount of times in the versions
 I've found. So do as many as you'd like! And at the end of the song just fade out with soft strumming.
  
  
 [Verse 1]
   My baby don't mess around
  
 Because she loves me so
      And this I know for sure
   But does she really wanna
  
 But can't stand to see me
       Walk out the door
   I can't stand to fight the feeling
                                       Because the thought alone is killing me right now
      But thank God for Mom and Dad
  
 For sticking two together

 Oh, you think you've got it
  
 But got it just don't get it
               'Til there's nothing at all
 We get together
 Oh, we get together
                                    But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
  
 If what they say is ""Nothing is forever.""
      Oh, then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
  
 Then what makes, what makes love the exception?
 So why oh, why oh
 Why oh, why oh, why oh, are we so in denial
 When we know we're not happy here

 [Verse 1]
      I really can't stay
                But baby it's cold outside
       I've got to go away
              But baby it's cold outside
       The evening has been
              Been hoping that you'd drop in
          So very nice
              I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
  
  
 [Chorus]
     My mother will start worry
                     Beautiful what’s your hurry?
       And father will be pacing the floor
                                    Listen to the fireplace roar
      So really i'd better scurry
                    Beautiful please don't hurry
       But maybe just a half a drink more
                               Put some records on while I pour
  
 [Verse 2]
      The neighbors might think
                     Baby it's bad out there
        Say, what's in this drink?
                    No cabs to be had out there
     I wish i knew how
               Your eyes are like starlight now
               To break the spell
                I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
  
 [Chorus]
     I ought to say, ""No, no, no sir""
                            Mind if I move in closer?
     At least i'm gonna say that i tried
                               What's the sense in hurtin' my pride?
      I really can't stay
                Baby don't hold out
               Ah, but it's cold outside
  
 [Verse 3]
    I simply must go 
              Baby, it's cold outside
      The answer is no
              Ooh darling, it's cold outside
 This welcome has been
                I'm lucky that you dropped in
              So nice and warm 
                 Look out the window at that storm
  
 [Chorus]
     My sister will be suspicious 
                    Man, your lips look delicious
     My brother will be there at the door
                                Waves upon a tropical shore
     My maiden aunt's mind is vicious 
                          Gosh your lips are delicious
       Well maybe just a half a drink more
                                Never such a blizzard before
  
 [Verse 4]
       I've got to go home
                Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
        Say, lend me your coat 
              It's up to your knees out there
         You've really been grand 
                 I thrill when you touch my hand
                But don't you see?
               How can you do this thing to me?
  
 [Chorus]
          There's bound to be talk tomorrow
                         Think of my life long sorrow
     At least there will be plenty implied 
                                If you caught pneumonia and died
     I really can't stay
               Get over that hold out
                Ahh, but it's cold outside

 [Verse 1]
  
 What doesn't kill you
    Makes you wish you were dead
         Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper
    And I can't take
             One more moment of this silence
             The loneliness is haunting me
             And the weight of the worlds getting harder to hold up

 [Verse 1]
   Virgil Caine is the name, and I served on the Danville train
  'Til Stoneman's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
  In the winter of '65, We were hungry, just barely alive
  By May the tenth, Richmond had fell, it's a time I remember, oh so well
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
      The night they drove Old Dixie down, and the bells were ringing
      The night they drove Old Dixie down, and the people were singin' 
            They went:  Naah, na, na, naah, na, na  Na, na, na, na, naah, na, na, na, na    [Link 2)
  
  
 [Verse 2]
   Back with my wife in Tennessee, when one day she called to me
   ""Virgil, quick, come see, there goes the Robert E. Lee!""
   Now I don't mind choppin' wood, and I don't care if the money's no good
     Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest
                  But they should never have taken the very best

 [Verse 3]
   Like my father before me, I will work the land
   Like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand
         He was just eighteen, proud and brave, but a Yankee laid him in his grave
   I swear by the mud below my feet
            You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat

 [Verse 1]
  
 Grace, what have you done?
 Murdered for me on that cross
    Accused in absence of wrong
    My sin washed away in Your blood
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
      Too much to make sense of it all
    I know that Your love breaks my fall

 Death, where is your sting?
       Your power is as dead as my sin
      The Cross has taught me to live
      And mercy, my heart now to sing
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus 2]
  
      The day and its troubles shall come
    I know that Your strength is enough
      The scandal of grace, You died in my place
        So my soul will live

         Lord I come, I   confess
 Bowing here   I find my rest
          Without You, I fall  apart
             You're the one   that guides my heart

                 Where sin runs deep, Your grace is more
                 Where grace is found is where You are
                And where You are Lord I am  free
      Holiness   is Christ in me
  
 [Chorus 2]

 Every hour I need You
     My one  defense, my righteousness
     Oh God, how I need  You
  
 [Bridge]
     So teach my song to rise to You
            When temptation comes my way
             And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You
        Jesus You're my hope and stay

 [I. Jesus of Suburbia]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 I'm the son of rage and love
 The Jesus of Suburbia
 From the Bible of none of the above
 On a steady diet of
  
 Soda pop and Ritalin
 No one ever died for my
 Sins in hell, as far as I can tell
 At least the ones I've gotten away with
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
  
 And there's nothing wrong with me
 This is how I'm supposed to be
 In a land of make-believe
  
 That don't believe in me
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Get my television fix
 Sitting on my crucifix
 The living room or my private womb
 While the moms and brads are away
  
 To fall in love and fall in debt
 To alcohol and cigarettes
 And Mary Jane to keep me insane
 And doing someone else's cocaine
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
  
 And there's nothing wrong with me
 This is how I'm supposed to be
 In a land of make-believe
  
 That don't believe in me
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
  
  
  
 [II. City of the Damned]
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
         At the center of the earth
         In the parking lot
         Of the 7-11 where I was taught
   The motto was just a lie
  
           It says ""home is where your heart is""
      But what a shame
        Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
   It's beating out of time
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
  
    City of the dead
   At the end of another lost highway
    Signs misleading to nowhere
  
    City of the damned
   Lost children with dirty faces today
    No one really seems to care
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
    I read the graffiti
         In the bathroom stall
           Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall
   And so it seemed to confess
  
     It didn't say much
         But it only confirmed
           That the center of the earth is the end of the world
   And I could really care less
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
  
    City of the dead
   At the end of another lost highway
    Signs misleading to nowhere
  
    City of the damned
   Lost children with dirty faces today
    No one really seems to care
  
  
 [III. I Don't Care]
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
 [Interlude]
  
 I don't care if you don't
 I don't care if you don't
 I don't care if you don't care   (x4)
  
 I don’t care...
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
  
 [Verse 5]
  
 Everyone is so full of shit
 Born and raised by hypocrites
 Hearts recycled but never saved
 From the cradle to the grave
 We are the kids of war and peace
 From Anaheim to the Middle East
 We are the stories and disciples
 Of the Jesus of Suburbia
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus 3]
  
 Land of make-believe
 And it don't believe in me
 Land of make-believe
 And I don't believe
  
  
 [Chorus 3]
  
      And I don’t care (x4)
      And I don’t care
  
  
 [IV. Dearly Beloved]
  
  
 [Verse 6]
  
 Dearly beloved are you listening?
 I can’t remember a word that you were saying
 Are we demented or am I disturbed?
 The space that's in between insane and insecure
  
  
 Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?
 Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed
 Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
 For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
  
 [V. Tales of Another Broken Home]
  
  
  
 [Verse 7]
  
 To live and not to  breathe
 Is to die in tragedy
 To run, to run away
 To find what you believe
  
  
 [Chorus 4]
  
      And I..             Leave be.. hind
  
 This hu..rri..cane of fu..cking lies
  
  
 [Verse 8]
  
 I lost my faith to this
 This town that don't exist
 So I run, I run away
 To the light of masochist
  
  
 [Chorus 4]
  
      And I..             Leave be.. hind
  
 This hu..rri..cane of fu..cking lies
  
      And I..             Walked this line
  
 A    mil..lion and one fu..cking times       But not this time
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
  
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 I don't feel any shame
    I won’t apologize
 When there ain't nowhere you can go
  
 Running away from pain
       When you've been victimized
 Tales from another broken...
  
  
 [Outro]
  
 Home...
         You’re leaving...
         You’re leaving...
         You’re leaving...
          Ah, you’re leaving home...

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
 On bended knee is no way to be free
 Lifting up an empty cup, I ask silently
 All my destinations will accept the one that's me
     So I can breathe
  
 [Verse 2]
 Circles they grow, and they swallow people whole
 Half their lives they say goodnight to wives they'll never know
    A mind full of questions, and a teacher in my soul
      And so it goes
  
 [Verse 3]
 Don't come closer or I'll have to go
 Holding me like gravity are places that pull
     If ever there was someone to keep me at home
     It would be you
  
 [Verse 4]
 Everyone I come across, in cages they bought
       They think of me and my wandering, but I'm never what they thought
       I've got my indignation, but I'm pure in all my thoughts
 I'm alive
  
 [Verse 5]
 Wind in my hair, I feel part of everywhere

 Late at night I hear the trees, they're singing with the dead
 Overhead

 Leave it to me as I find a way to be
     Consider me a satellite forever orbiting
 I knew all the rules, but the rules did not know me

 [Verse]
  
   Happiness hit her like a train on a track...
   Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back...
   She hid around corners and she hid under beds
   She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
       With every bubble she sank with her drink
        And washed it away down the kitchen sink

                          How did our eyes get so red, and what the hell is on Joey's head?
 And this is where I grew up, I think the present owner fixed it up,
                               I never knew we ever went without,the second floor is high for sneakin' out.
 And this is where I went to school, most of the time had better things to do,
                                  Criminal record says I broke in twice, I must have done it half a dozen times.
 I wonder if it's too late, should I go back and try to graduate,
 Life's better now than it was back then, if I was them I wouldn't let me
 in...
  
 [Chorus]
              Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!
 Every memory of lookin out the back door, I had the photo album spread
                    out on my bedroom floor, It's hard to say it, time to say it
 Good-bye, Good-bye.
 Every memory of walkin out the front door, I found the photo of the friend
                     that I was looking for, It's hard to say it, time to say it
 Good-Bye, Good-Bye.
  
 [Verse 2]
 Remember the old arcade? Blew every dollar that we ever made.
                            The Cops hated us hangin' out, they say somebody went and burned it down.
                          We use to listen to the radio and sing along with every song we'd know.
                                       We said someday we'd find out how it feels to sing to more than just the
           steering wheel.
 Kim's the first girl I kissed. I was so nervous that I nearly missed.
                                   She's had a couple of kids since then. I haven't seen her since god knows
 when.
  
 [Chorus]
            Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!
 Every memory of lookin out the back door, I had the photo album spread
                    out on my bedroom floor, It's hard to say it, time to say it
 Good-bye, Good-bye.
 Every memory of walkin out the front door, I found the photo of the friend
                               that I was looking for, It's hard to say it, time to say it
 Good-Bye, Good-Bye.
  
 [Bridge]
 I miss that town, I miss their faces
                  You can't erase, You can't replace it.
             I miss it now. I can't believe it.
              So hard to stay. To hard to leave it.
 If I could relive those days I know the one thing that would never change...
  
 [Chorus]
 N.C.
 Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!
 Every memory of lookin out the back door, I had the photo album spread
                    out on my bedroom floor, It's hard to say it, time to say it

 Look at this photograph...every time I do it makes me laugh.

 I couldn't ask for anything better
 He opens up my door and I get into his car
     And he says you look beautiful tonight
             And I feel perfectly fine
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
             But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
           And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
         You're so in love that you act insane
      And that's the way I loved you
 Breakin' down and coming undone
        It's a roller coaster kinda rush
       And I never knew I could feel that much
      And that's the way I loved you
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 He respects my space
      And never makes me wait
      And he calls exactly when he says he will
 He's close to my mother
 Talks business with my father
       He's charming and endearing
          And I'm comfortable
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
             But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
           And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
         You're so in love that you act insane
      And that's the way I loved you
 Breakin' down and coming undone
        It's a roller coaster kinda rush
       And I never knew I could feel that much
      And that's the way I loved you
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 He can't see the smile I'm faking
                     And my heart's not breaking
                         'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
      And you were wild and crazy
 Just so frustrating, intoxicating, complicated
 Got away by some mistake and now
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
             But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
           And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
      I'm so in love that I acted insane
      And that's the way I loved you
 Breakin' down and coming undone
        It's a roller coaster kinda rush
       And I never knew I could feel that much
      And that's the way I loved you, oh
      And that's the way I loved you, oh
    Never knew I could feel that much
      And that's the way I loved you

 [Verse 1]
     Counting days, counting days
                           Since my love up and got lost on me
   An' every breath that I've been takin'
            Since you left feels like a waste on me
    I've been holdin' on to hope
                   That you'll come back when you can find some peace
   'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
            Since you left feels like a hollow street

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
 There's a calm surrender
 To the rush of day
 When the heat of a rolling wind
 Can be turned away
 An enchanted moment
 And it sees me through
 It's enough for this restless warrior
 Just to be with you
  
  
 [Chorus]
      And can you feel the love tonight ?
    It is where we   are
    It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
 That we   got this far
      And can you feel the love tonight ?
    How it's laid to  rest ?
    It's enough to make kings and  vagabonds
    Believe the   ve - ry    best
  
  
 [Interlude]
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 There's a time for everyone
 If they only learn
 That the twisting kaleidoscope
 Moves us all in turn
 There's a rhyme and reason
 To the wild outdoors
 When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
 Beats in time with yours
  
  
 [Chorus]
      And can you feel the love tonight ?
    It is where we   are
    It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
 That we   got this far

 Capo IV  *
  
  
     It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
 If you don't know by now
         An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
 It will never do somehow
            When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
 Look out your window and I'll be gone
 You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
 Don't think twice, it's all right
  
     It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
 That light I never knowed
         An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
 I'm on the dark side of the road
          Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
 To try and make me change my mind and stay
 We never did too much talkin' anyway
 So don't think twice, it's all right
  
     It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
 Like you never done before
     It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
 I can't hear you any more
        I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walking down the road
 I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
 I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
 But don't think twice, it's all right
  
 So long honey babe
 Where I'm bound, I can't tell
 Goodbye is too good a word, babe
     So I just say fare thee well
 I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
      You could have done better but I don't mind
 You just kinda wasted my precious time
 But don't think twice, it's all right
  
      I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
            Where I'm bound, I can't tell
      But goodbye's too good a word, gal
 So I'll just say fare thee well
          I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
      You could have done better but I don't mind
 You just kinda wasted my precious time
 But don't think twice, it's all right

 [Verse 1]
  
             Come, thou Fount of every blessing,
          tune my heart to sing thy grace;
              streams of mercy, never ceasing,
             call for songs of loudest praise.
           Teach me some melodious sonnet,
           sung by flaming tongues above.
            Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it,
           mount of thy unchanging love.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
     Here I raise my Ebenezer;
          hither by thy help I'm come;
        and I hope, by thy good pleasure,
         safely to arrive at home.
         Jesus sought me when a stranger,
            wandering from the fold of God;
         he, to rescue me from danger,
       interposed his precious blood.
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
        O to grace how great a debtor
        daily I'm constrained to be!
          Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
          bind my wandering heart to thee.
           Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
           prone to leave the God I love;
            here's my heart, O take and seal it,
          seal it for thy courts above.

 And brushes her long blonde hair

 She grew up in an Indiana town
        Had a good-lookin' mama who never was around
         But she grew up tall and she grew up right
            With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 Well she moved down here at the age of eighteen
              She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen
 I was introduced and we both started groovin'
              She said, ""I dig you baby but I got to keep movin'""
  
 ...on, keep movin' on

 Tired of myself, tired of this town

 Buy me a drink, sing me a song,
 Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long

 It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
 From the dusty mesa
 Her looming shadow grows
 Hidden in the branches
 of the poison creosote
  
  
 [Verse 2]
           She twines her spines up slowly
      Towards the boiling sun
       And when I touched her skin
        My fingers ran with blood
  
 [Interlude]
  
 [Verse 3]
   In the hushing dusk
            Under a swollen silver moon
      I came walking with the wind
      To watch the cactus bloom
  
  
 [Verse 4]
      A strange hunger haunted me,
         The looming shadows danced
      I fell down to the thorny brush
       And felt a trembling hand
  
 [Interlude]
  
 [Verse 5]
    When the last light warms the rocks
            And the rattlesnakes unfold
    Mountain cats will come
      to drag away your bones
  
  
 [Verse 6]
        And rise with me forever
     Across the silent sand
           And the stars will be your eyes

 Naalala ko pa 
            Nung nililigawan pa
   Lamang kita 
 Dadalaw tuwing gabi
    Masilayan lamang ang yong
 Mga ngiti
   At Ikay sasabihan 
              Bukas ng alas siyete sa dating 
 Tagpuan
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Buo ang araw ko 
 Marinig ko lang ang mga 
 Himig mo 
 Hindi ko man alam kung nasan ka
 Wala man tayong komunikasyon
 Mag hihintay sayo buong magdamag
      Dahil ikaw ang buhay ko

 Kung inaakala mo 
      Ang pag-ibig ko'y magbabago
    Itaga mo sa bato
 Dumaan man ang maraming pasko
  
 Kahit na di mo na abot ang sahig
 Kahit na di mo nako marinig 
 Ikaw parin ang buhay ko
 Huhuhow yeah

      Haharanahin ka lagi
 Kung inaakala mo 
    Ang pag-ibig koy magbabago
 Itaga mo sa bato
 Pumuti man ang mga buhok ko
 Kahit na kumulubot ang balat
 Kahit na hirap ka ng huminga
 Kahit na di mo na abot ang sahig

 particular version is from Carroll College - Waukesha, WI, 11/01/03.

 Notes: The Dsus after the D in the last line of the verses isn't required. I play
 it to give the song a slightly higher pitch right leading into the chorus. When
 you play it, make sure you hit the first string U/U/D/U and then change back to a
 D after that U/U/D/U strumming sequence. Give it a try, I think it sounds better
 that way. Also, on the 4th line of second and third verses, Marc mutes the C
 chord right after switching to it and finishes the line ""a cappella."" Then start
 up with G again normally on the next line. Same thing with the last line on the
 third verse - mute the G and then it's a cappella until the G in the beginning of the chorus.

 Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why
 Without you It's hard to survive.

 Your mouth is a revolver firing bullets in the sky
 Your love is like a soldier, loyal till you die
 And I've been looking at the stars for a long, long time

 This world is getting colder, strangers passing by
 No one offers you a shoulder. No one looks you in the eye
 But I've been looking at you for a long, long time

       But under your covers more torture than pleasure
       And just past your lips there's more anger than laughter
      Not now or forever will I ever change you

 [Verse 1]
                    It's late in the evening, glass on the side, I've been sat with you for most of the night
             Ignoring everybody here, we wish they would disappear, so maybe we could get down now
     And I don't wanna know, If you're getting ahead of the program
 I want you to be mine, lady
     To hold your body close, take another step into the no-man's land
 For the longest time lady
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
    I need you darling, come on set the tone, if you feel you're falling
 Won't you let me know
 Oh oh oh
 Oh oh oh
 If you love me come on get involved,
 feel it rushing through you, from your head to toe
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
  
 [Chorus]
       Sing! Oh oh oh oh oh 
        Louder! Oh oh oh oh  Sing oh oh oh 
  
 [Verse 2]
                This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage, 
  
 and the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
      Until then we've got nothing to say and nothing to know
 But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
 Let it go until our roads will change, 
 Singing we found love in a local rave
 No I don't really know what I'm supposed to say, 
 But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
 I told her my name, I said it's nice to meet you, 
 Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
 I already know she's a keeper, just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
 Deep shit If anybody finds out I'm meant to drive home, but I took all of it down
 Not sobering up we sit on the couch
 One thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 I need you darling, come on set the tone, if you feel you're falling
 Won’t you let me know
 Oh oh oh
 Oh oh oh
 If you love me come on get involved, 
 feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh 
  
 [Chorus]
        Sing! Oh oh oh oh oh 
        Louder! Oh oh oh oh  Sing oh oh oh 
  
 [Bridge]
           Can you feel it, all the guys in here don't even want to dance
           Can you feel it, all that I can hear is music from the back
           Can you feel it, I found you hiding here so wont you take my hand
           Darling, before the beat kicks in again
           Can you feel it
          Ooh oh oh
          Can you feel it
          Oh oh no
  
 [Ending]
 I need you darling, come on set the tone, if you feel you're falling
 Won’t you let me know
 Oh oh oh
 Oh oh oh
 If you love me come on get involved, 
 feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh

 [Verse 1]
 Nights in white satin,   never reaching the end,
 Letters I've written, never meaning to send.
 Beauty I've always missed, with these eyes before,
 Just what the truth is,  I can't say any more
  
 [Chorus]
         'Cos I love you, yes I love you, oh, how I love you.
  
 [Verse 2]
 Gazing at people,  some hand in hand,
 Just what I'm going through,   they can't understand.
 Some try to tell me,   thoughts they cannot defend,
 Just what you want to be,   you'll be in the end.
  
 [Chorus]
        And I love you, yes I love you, oh, how I love you.

 Lazin' on a sunny afternoon

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse I]
 I can think of all the times
 You told me not to touch the light
    I never thought that you would be the one
  
    I couldn't really justify
      How you even thought it could be right
 Cause everything we cherished is gone
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
             And in the end can you tell me if
         It was worth the try
             So I can decide
  
 [Chorus]
 Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
      And all will be alright in time
       From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
      And all will be alright in time
          Ohh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive
  
 [Verse II]
 Try as hard as I might
 To flee the shadows of the night
     It haunts me and it makes me feel blue
      But how can I try to hide
             When every breath and every hour
     I still end up thinking of you
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
            And in the end everythng we have
            Makes it worth the fight
             So I will hold on for as long

     As Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
      And all will be alright in time
       From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
      And all will be alright in time
          Ohh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive
  
 [Bridge]
 I never thought that I would see the day
 That I'd decide if I should leave or stay
 But in the end what makes it worth the fight's
 that no matter what happens we try to make it right
  
 [Chorus]
 Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
      And all will be alright in time
 From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
      And all will be alright in time
  
 Wounds of the past will eventually heal
      And all will be alright in time
         'Cause all of this comes with a love that is real
         I said all will be alright in time         (4x)
  
 [Outro]
           Ohh, you never really love someone until
                  You learn to forgive         (3x)

 Feelin' lit feelin' like 2 a.m. summer night
 I don't care, hand on the wheel, drivin drunk, I’m doin' my thing
 Rollin the midwest side and out livin' my life gettin' out dreams
 People told me slow my road I'm screaming out fuck that
 Im'ma do just what I want lookin' ahead no turnin' back
 If I fall if I die know I lived it to the fullest
 If I fall if I die know I lived and missed some bullets

 You don’t really know about nothin' nothin'
 Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night

 Rather lay awake in a path full of sorrow

 City of stars

      Who knows?
                           I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you

 There in the bars

       It's love
                                Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else

 To look in somebody's eyes
                  To light up the skies
              To open the world and send them reeling
 A voice that says, I'll be here
                 And you'll be alright
 I don't care if I know
                    Just where I will go
                    'Cause all that I need's this crazy feeling
 A rat-tat-tat on my heart…

 It's been seven hours and fifteen days
 since you took your love away
 I go out every night and sleep all day
 since you took your love away
 Since you been gone I can do what-ever I want
 I can see whomever I choose
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
      but nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues
       'cos nothing compares
 nothing compares 2 U.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 It's been so lonely without U here
 like a bird without a song
 nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
            tell me baby where did I go wrong?
 I could put my arms around every boy I see
       but they only remind me of U.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 I went to the doctor and guess what he told me guess what he told me
              he said: ""girl U better try to have fun no matter what U do""
  
 but he's a fool
       'cos nothing compares
 nothing compares 2U.

 All the flowers that U planted mama
                       in the back yard
                              all died when U went away

 I know that living with U baby was sometimes hard
 but I'm willing 2 give U another try
       'cos nothing compares
 nothing compares 2U.

              Well, I was there on the day
  
 They sold the cause for the queen,
               And when the lights all went out
  
 We watched our lives on the screen.
             I hate the ending myself,
                                  But it started with an alright scene.
  
             It was the roar of the crowd
  
 That gave me heartache to sing.
           It was a lie when they smiled
  
 And said, ""you won't feel a thing"".
            And as we ran from the cops
                               We laughed so hard it would sting

             I spent my high school career
  
 Spit on and shoved to agree

 It’s strange to think the songs we used to sing
                  The smiles, the flowers, everything... is gone
 Yesterday I found out about you
 Even now just looking at you... feels wrong
 You say that you’d take it all back, given one chance
                    It was a moment of weakness and you said yes
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                     You should’ve said no, you should’ve gone home
                        You should’ve thought twice before you let it all go
      You should’ve known that word, bout what you did with her
                    Would get back to me...
                       And I should’ve been there, in the back of your mind
                 I shouldn’t be asking myself why
      You shouldn’t be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
                     You should’ve said no, baby and you might still have me
  
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 You can see that I’ve been crying
 And baby you know all the right things... to say
      But do you honestly expect me to believe
 We could ever be the same
 You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
                    It was a moment of weakness and you said yes
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                     You should’ve said no, you should’ve gone home
                        You should’ve thought twice before you let it all go
      You should’ve known that word, bout what you did with her
                    Would get back to me...
                       And I should’ve been there, in the back of your mind
                 I shouldn’t be asking myself why
      You shouldn’t be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
                     You should’ve said no, baby and you might still have me
  
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 I can’t resist… before you go, tell me this
        Was it worth it…
         Was she worth this…
  
 Nooooo no... no, no,  no,  no...

 [Verse 1]
            I was walking down the street,
                 When out the corner of my eye
            I saw a pretty little thing approaching me.
                  She said ""I've never seen a man
        Who looks so all alone,
              Could you use a little company?
          If you pay the right price
         Your evening will be nice,
              And you can go and send me on my way.""
                   I said ""You're such a sweet young thing
          Why you do this to yourself?""
        She looked at me and this is what she said,
  
 [Chorus]
   ""Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked,
   Money don't grow on trees.
     I got bills to pay,
         I got mouths to feed,
               There ain't nothing in this world for free.
           I know I can't slow down,
     I can't hold back,
              Though you know, I wish I could.
            No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
           Until we close our eyes for good"".
  
 [Verse 2]
            Not even fifteen minutes later
                 I'm still walking down the street,
            When I saw a shadow of a man creep out of sight.
                  Then he walks up from behind
        And puts a gun up to my head,
              He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight.
                 He said ""Give me all you've got
        I want your money not your life,
              But if you try to make a move I won't think twice.""
                 I said ""You can have my cash
        But first you know I got to ask
              What made you want to live this kind of life?""
  
 [Chorus]
   He said ""There ain't no rest for the wicked,
   Money don't grow on trees.
     I got bills to pay,
         I got mouths to feed,
              There ain't nothing in this world for free.
           I know I can't slow down,
     I can't hold back,
              Though you know, I wish I could.
            No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
           Until we close our eyes for good"".
  
 [Verse 3]
            Now a couple hours passed
                 And I was sitting at my house,
              The day was winding down and coming to an end.
            So I turned on the TV
                 And flipped it over to the news,
              And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend.
          I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church,
                   He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills.
                 But even still I can't say much
                 Because I know we're all the same,
              Oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills.
  
 [Chorus]
   ""Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked,
   Money don't grow on trees.
     I got bills to pay,
         I got mouths to feed,
               There ain't nothing in this world for free.
           Oh no we can't slow down,
     We can't hold back,
              Though you know, we wish we could.
            No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
           Until we close our eyes for good"".

 If you're travelin' in the north country fair,
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
 Remember me to one who lives there.
 She once was a true love of mine.
  
 Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm,
 When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
 Please see if she has a coat so warm,
     To keep her from the howlin' winds.
  
 Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
 If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
 Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
 That's the way I remember her best.
  
 I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all.
 Many times I've often prayed
 In the darkness of my night,
 In the brightness of my day.
  
 So if you're travelin' in the north country fair,
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
 Remember me to one who lives there.
 She once was a true love of mine.

 [Verse 1]
  
            It's not time to make a change, just re-lax, take it easy,
                 You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to know,
          Find a girl, settle down, if you want, you can marry,
          Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
          I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy to be calm,
                When you've found something going on,    but take your time, think a lot,
                    Why, think of everything you've got, for you will still be here to-morrow,
              But your dreams may not
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
          How can I try to ex-plain?    When I do , he turns a-way again!
         It's always been the same,   the same old story,
              From the moment I could talk, I was ordered to listen,
                 Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go away,
      I know I have to go

      ( A-way ,        a-way,           a-way )
  
                 You're still young,    that's you're fault       there's so much

           Look at me ,    I am old, but I'm happy
           ( No !)
  
  
 [Verse 6]
  
            All the times that I cried, keeping all the things I knew inside,
       ( Stay ,       stay,         stay )
  
         It's hard,      but it's harder    to ig-nore it!
           ( Why---          ---must---        ---you go ,and make---
  
                     If they were     right, I'd a-gree, but it's them, they know, not me,

 Nobody knows
                    Just why we're here
 Could it be fate
                       Or random circumstance
 At the right place
                  At the right time
            Two roads intertwine
  
 And if the universe conspired
                    To meld our lives
 To make us
            Fuel and fire
 Then know
                  Where ever you will be
            So too shall I be
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   Close your eyes
                Dry your tears
            'Coz when nothing seems clear
                     You'll be safe here
                      From the sheer weight
                  Of your doubts and fears
             Weary heart
                    You'll be safe here
  
  
   Remember how we laughed
                Until we cried
            At the most stupid things
                     Like we were so high
                      But love was all that we were on
                  We belong
  
   And though the world would
                Never understand
            This unlikely union
                     And why it still stands
                    Someday we will be set free.
                  Pray and believe
  
  
 [Chorus]

 From your tears
 When everything's unclear

 From the sheer weight
 Of your doubts and fears
 Wounded heart
  
 When the light disappears
 And when this world's insincere
 You'll be safe here
  
 When nobody hears you scream
 I'll scream with you
 You'll be safe here
  
 In my arms
 Through the long cold night
 Sleep tight
 You'll be safe here
  
 When no one understands
 I'll believe
 You'll be safe,
 You'll be safe
 You'll be safe here
 Put your heart in my hands
 You'll be safe here

         On the first page of our story
        the future seemed so bright
         then this thing turned out so evil
                 I don't know why I'm still surprised
         even angels have their wicked schemes
        and you take that to new extremes

        even though you've lost your mind

 [Verse]
  
 You’re my piece of mind
 In this crazy world
                          You’re every thing I’ve tried to find
              E-B
 Your love is pearl
            You’re my Mona Lisa
            You’re my rainbow skies
 And my only prayer is that you realize
 You'll always be beautiful in my eyes
  
 The world will turn
 And the seasons will change 
                      And all the lessons we will learn
                       E-B
 Will be beautiful and strange
             We’ll have our fell of tears
 Our share of sight
 My only prayer is that you realize
 You’ll always be beautiful in my eyes
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                  You will always be beautiful in my eyes
                       And the passing years will show
                       That you will always grow
       Even more beautiful in my eyes 
  
 there are lines upon my face
  
 From a lifetime of smiles
                      and when the time comes to embrace
                   E-B
 For one long last wine
         We can laugh about, how time really flies
 We won’t say goodbye
                  Cause true love never dies
   You’ll always be beautiful in my eyes…
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                  You will always be beautiful in my eyes

 Wait 'til you're announced
  
 We've not yet lost all our graces
  
 The hounds will stay in chains
  
 Look upon your greatness
  
 And she'll send the call out

 That divides me somewhere in my mind
 On the border line
 Of the edge and where I walk alone

 What's fucked up and everything's alright
 Check my vital signs
 To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

 Will it make it easier on you

       Who knows how long I've loved you
       You know I love you still
 Will I wait a lonely lifetime
          If you want me to I will

      I didn't catch your name
 But it never really mattered
           I will always feel the same

 Love you forever and forever
 Love you with all my heart
 Love you whenever we're together
 Love you when we're apart

        And when at last I find you
            Your song will fill the air
 Sing it loud so I can hear you
           Make it easy to be near you
            For the things you do endear you to me
 Ah, you know I will
     I will

 If you play the solo instead of the intrumental, then play it four times over, then
 into this part.

 [Verse]
   I know a girl she puts the color inside of my world.
      But she's just like a maze, where all of the walls all continually change.
     And I've done all I can to stand on her steps with my heart in my hand.
     Now I'm starting to see, maybe its got nothing to do with me.
  
 [Chorus]
 Fathers be good to your daugh-ters.
 Daughters will love like you do.
 Girls become lovers, who turn into mothers  
      So, mothers be good to your daughters too.

 [Bridge]
 Oooh, you see that skin?
               It's the same she's been standing in...
     since the day, she saw him walking away, now she's left...
                           cleaning up the mess he made.
 So
  
 [Chorus]
 Fathers be good to your daugh-ters.
 Daughters will love like you do.
 Girls become lovers, who turn into mothers 
      So, mothers be good to your daughters too.
  
 [Verse]
   Boys you can break, you'll find out how much they can take.
                     Boys will be strong, and boys soldier on but boys would be gone without
                  warmth from a woman's good, good heart.

 you are the god and the weight of her world.

 [Verse 1]
      Elementary pa lang napapansin na nila
   Mga gawi kong parang hindi pambabae e kasi
   Imbes na Chinese garter laruan ko ay teks at jolens
   Tapos ka-jamming ko lagi noon mga sigang lalaki sa amin
  
   Nung ako’y mag-high school ay napabarkadasa mga bi
   Curious na babae na ang hanap din ay babae
   Sa halip na makeup kit bitbit ko ay gitara
   Tapos pormahan ko lagi ay long sleeves na
   tshirt at faded na lonta
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
   Pero noong nakilala kita nagbagong bigla
                     ang aking timpla natuto ako na magparebond 
         at mag-ahit ng kilay at least once a month
  
   Hindi ko alam kung anong meron ka na sa
   akin ay nagpalambot nang bigla
             Sinong mag-aakalang lalake pala ang bibihag
                   sa tulad kong tigreng gala
  
  
 [Chorus]
                Kahit ako’y titibo-tibo..
                Puso ko ay titibok-tibok parin sa’yo
         Isang halik mo lamang at ako ay tinatablan
                    At ang aking pagkababae ay nabubuhayan
           Na para bang bulaklak na namumukadkad
          Dahil alaga mo sa dilig at katamtamang
                 Sikat ng araw-araw mong pag-ibig

 [Verse 2]
   Nung tayo’y nag-college ay saka ko lamang
           binigay ang matamis na oo
            Sampung buwan mong trinabaho
       Sa halip na tsokolate at tipikal na mga diskarte
    Nabihag mo ko sa mga tula at sa mga kanta mong pabebe
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
   Kaya nga noong makilala kita alam mo na agad na 
  
 mayroong himala
   Natuto akong magtakong at napadalas ang
   pagsuot ng bestidang pula
  
      Pero di mo naman inasam na ako ay
  
 magbabagong tuluyan para patunayang
   Walang matigas na tinapay sa mainit na
                    kape ng iyong pagmamahal

 !IMPORTANT NOTE!:
 if you play this in standard tuning along to the song it will sound awful.
 That's because the song is tuned about 50 cents down, so 1/4 note (1/2 half note!!)
  
 [Verse]
  
 Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind
 Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind
 Got no way to prove it so maybe I'm blind
               But I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all

 Do you see it clearer or are you deceived in what you believe

 Don't ask my opinion
 don't ask me to lie
 Then beg for forgiveness 
 for making you cry, making you cry

 Fun - We Are Young
  
 Notes*:
      -The Gm and Am at the end of verse 1 and
      the outro are just the triads of Gm and Am
      the low note of the chord isnt necessarily
      an A or a G.
  
      -I would only play the slash chords if your
      either trying to be super accurate or playing
      piano. Otherwise this isn't ease to sing and play
  
      -The Guitar during verse two plays power chords
      rather than the whole chord.
  
      -To make the song even easier you could tranpose
      the chords down 5 half-steps and play with a capo
      on the fifth fret.

 and I know I gave it to you months ago
 I know you're trying to forget but between the drinks and subtle things
                                the holes in my apologies you know I'm trying hard to take it back
 so if by the time the bar closes and you feel like falling down

        Now I know that I'm not all that you got
 I guess that I I just thought maybe we could find a ways to fall apart
 But our friends in back So let's raise the tab

 [Verse 1]
  
 I stare at my reflection in the mirror
 Why am I doing this to myself
 Losing my mind on a tiny error
 I nearly left the real me on the shelf
              No, no, no, no

 Don't loose who you are in the blur of the stars
 Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing

                      to follow your heart
 Tears don't mean you're losing

 I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
 Yeah this time I'm not leaving without you

 Sit back down on the couch where we
 Made love for the first time
 And you said to me

 Something about lonely nights and my lipstick on your face

 I could've listened to a joke for rock n roll
 And muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart

 With a guitar hummin and no clothes
 This time I'm not leavin without you

 Still want my lipstick all over your face

      I was a little too tall, coulda' used a few pounds
      Tight pants, points, hardly renown
      She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
      And points all her own sittin' way up high             way up firm and high
      Out past the cornfields, where the woods got heavy
      Out in the backseat of my sixty Chevy
      Workin on mysteries without any clues

      We weren't searching for some high in the sky summit
      We were just young and restless and bored      living by the sword
      And we'd steal away every chance we could 
      To the back room, alley, or the trusty woods
      I used her, she used me but neither one cared      we were getting our share

 Home where my music's playing,
 Home where my love lies waiting
 Silently for me.

 Ev'ry day's an endless stream
     Of cigarettes and magazines, mmmm
      And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
      And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,
  
  
 [Chorus]
           Homeward bound, I wish I was,
           Homeward bound,
 Home where my thought's escaping
 Home where my music's playing,
 Home where my love lies waiting
 Silently for me.
  
  
 [Verse 3]
    Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
       I'll play the game and pretend, mmmm
      But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
       Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.
  
  
 [Chorus]
           Homeward bound, I wish I was,
           Homeward bound,
 Home where my thought's escaping
 Home where my music's playing,
 Home where my love lies waiting
 Silently for me.
  
  
 [Outro]
   Silently for me.

 There comes a time when we heed a certain call
             When the world must come together as one
               There are people dying

      The greatest gift of all

 We're all a part of God's great big family
     And the truth
 You know love is all we need

 I'd roll out of bed in the morning

      And chase after girls

 LANDSLIDE (Stevie Nicks - Fleetwood Mac)
 ------------------------
 A few notes:
  
 I modified this from the awesome tab originally posted by indigo@cats.ucsc.edu (Adam Schneider)
 I fixed a couple of verses where the chord progression was incorrect (probably cut & paste error).
 I read a comment in the original post that says that the Solo is incorrect because it is tabbed from the nut
 when the rest of the song is tabbed from Capo 3.  So, it would be logical to add 3 to every note in the tab;
 but I don't play the solo on my acoustic so I don't know if that is correct or not.
  
  * Capo 3rd Fret
  
  * All the chords are one measure in duration, except ""Am7 - G/B,"" which is
 one measure _total_.
  
  * D7/F# is 200212 but is easier to play as 20021x so you don't have to use your thumb.  I find it easiest if
 I play it like an Am and move my middle finger to the Low E string in the 2nd Fret.  This works because the
 picking pattern won't include the Hi E string anyway.  And, there is a transition from Am to D7/F# when she
 sings ""Built my life around you"" so if you get in the habit of using the Am chord form, it is an easy
 transition. (I think the chorus actually sounds better with the Am to D7/F# transition instead of Am7 to D7/F#
 but either way sounds great)
  
 Adam's original notes regarding the solor are below:
  * In the guitar solo, ""/"" is a slide, ""="" is a hammer-on or pull-off, and
 the marks underneath are for timing.  The timing is pretty accurate.
  * Some of the places in the guitar solo where I put hammer-ons or pull-offs
 should probably be bends (e.g., 10=12 should maybe be 10b12).  But I don't
 have an electric guitar, so I can't do whole-step bends.
  * I might not have put the solo on the right strings; the _notes_ are
 right, but where I notated a 3 on the E-string, it might really be an 8 on
 the B string, and so on.  Use whichever fingering works best for you.

 A|3-------3-------|2-------2-------|0-------0-------|2-------2-------|
 E|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
  
 When you get to the last chord progression before the chorus (and the last chord progression of the solo,
 just change the bass note string (played with your thumb) to the Low E string for the D7/F# chord as follows:
  
    E|----------------|----------------|
 B|------1-------1-|------1-------1-|
 G|--2-------2-----|--2-------2-----|
 D|----0-------0---|----0-------0---|
 A|----------------|----------------|

 When picking the Em, Lindsey plays a slight variation of that picking pattern.
 He alternates his thumb between the Low E and the A strings.
 For the 2nd Em chord, in the 5th note of the picking pattern, he does a hammer-on on the B string.
 The pattern looks like this:
  
    E|----------------|------------------|

 I see the King of glory
 Coming down the clouds with fire
                  The whole earth shakes
                  The whole earth shakes

 Washing over all our sin

 Rising up to take the place

 I see a near revival
 Stirring as we pray and seek

 Everything I am for your kingdom come
 As i walk from earth in to eternity

 I am an old woman named after my mother.
 My old man is another child that's grown old.

 this old house would've burnt down a long time ago.

 the years just flow by like a broken-down dam.

     Minamasdan Kita
        Nang hindi mo alam
 Pinapangarap kong ikaw ay akin
 Mapupulang labi at Matingkad mong ngiti
 Umaabot hanggang sa langit
 Huwag ka lang titingin sa akin at baka matunaw ang puso kong sabik.
  
  
 [Chorus]
             Sa iyong ngiti ako’y nahuhumaling
          At sa tuwing ikaw ay gagalaw
        Ang Mundo ko’y tumitigil
 Para lang sa iyo ang awit ng aking puso
 Sana’y mapansin mo rin ang lihim kong pagtingin.
  
  
 [Verse]
     Minamahal kita ng di mo alam
 Huwag ka sanang magagalit
 Tinamaan yata talaga ang aking puso
 Na dati ay akala ko’y manhid.
 Hindi pa rin makalapit
 Inuunahan ng kaba sa aking dibdib
  
  
 [Chorus]
             Sa iyong ngiti ako’y nahuhumaling
          At sa tuwing ikaw ay gagalaw

                Para lang sa iyo ang awit ng aking puso
 Sana’y mapansin mo rin ang lihim kong pagtingin.

 You're a good soldier
 Choosing your battles
 Pick yourself up
                    And dust yourself off
 And back in the saddle
  
 You're on the frontline
 Everyone's watching
 You know it's serious
                We're getting closer
 This isnt over
  
 The pressure is on
 You feel it
 But you've got it all
 Believe it

 Oh oh...

 Eh eh...

 I found that love was no friend of mine
 I should have known time after time

                I'll show you mine if you show me yours first
                Let's compare scars I'll tell you whose is worse
        Let's unwrite these pages and replace them with our own words
  
 [Chorus]
     We live on front porches and swing life away
     We get by just fine here on minimum wage
     If love is a labor I'll slave 'til the end
    I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand
  
 [Verse 2]
                    I've been here so long; think that its time to move
                  The winter's so cold summer's over too soon
     so let's pack our bags and settle down where palm trees grow
                I've got some friends, some that I hardly know
                     But we've had some times I wouldn't trade for the world
                 We chase these days down with talks of the places that we will go
  
 [Chorus]
     We live on front porches and swing life away
     We get by just fine here on minimum wage
     If love is a labor I'll slave 'til the end
    I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand
 Swing life away
 Swing life away
 Swing life away
 Swing life away

 [Verse 1]
 I'm tired of being what you want me to be
 Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
 I don't know what you're expecting of me
      Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
      (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
        Every step that I take is another mistake to you
                                  (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
  
  
 [Chorus]
 I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
            Become so tired, so much more aware
               I'm becoming this, all I want to do
                  Is be more like me and be less like you
  
  
 [Verse 2]
                              Can't you see that you're smothering me?
 Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
 'Cause everything that you thought I would be
      Has fallen apart, right in front of you
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
       (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
 Every step that I take is another mistake to you
                                (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
            And every second I waste is more than I can take
  
  
 [Chorus]
 I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
            Become so tired, so much more aware

 For six long years I've been in trouble 
            No pleasure here on earth I found 
 For in this world I'm bound to ramble

            My face you never will see no more 
 But there is one promise that is given 
                  I'll meet you on God's golden shore

 [Verse 1]
 She says it's cold outside and hands me her raincoat
 She's always worried about things like that
 Well, she says it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault
           And she only sleeps while it's raining
           And she screams and her voice is straining
  
  
 [Chorus]
           She says baby
          It's 3 AM, I must be lonely
 And she says baby
                 Well, I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes

 [Verse 2]
 She's got a little bit of something, God it's better than nothing
 And in her color portrait world she believes that she's got it all
 And she swears that the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to
          And she only sleeps when it's raining
          And she screams, and her voice is straining

 [Verse 3]
 She believes that life isn't made up of all that she used to
 And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days and days
 She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway, yeah
      But outside it's stopped raining

 Drink up, baby, stay up all night.
             With the things you could do,
       You won't but you might.
         The potential you'll be,
         That you'll never see,
        The promises you'll only make.

 Do what I say,

 Drink up, baby, look at the stars.

              With your hands in the air,
 Waiting to finally be caught.
        Drink up one more time,
       And I'll make you mine.
 Keep you apart,
 Deep in my heart,
        Separate from the rest,
           Where I like you the best,
        And keep the things you forgot.

 Note: for the Am/F#, I like to just reach across with my middle finger, which is on the
 fret of the D string using my Am open fingering, and hit the second fret on the low E
 The point of my finger holds down the string while the fleshy part mutes the A string. I
 this sounds better and is a lot easier than using some weird fingering to get a proper
 with all six strings ringing.

 I never thought I'd die alone

 Who says I can’t get stoned?
 Turn off the lights and the telephone
 Me and my house alone
 Who says I can’t get stoned?
  
 Who says I can’t be free?
 From all of the things that I used to be
 Re-write my history
 Who says I can’t be free?
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
  
              It’s been a long night in New York City
              It’s been a long night in Baton Rouge
 I don’t remember you looking any better
      But then again I don’t remember you
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Who says I can't get stoned?
 Call up a girl that I used to know
 Fake love for an hour or so
 Who says I can't get stoned?
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 Who says I can't take time?
 Meet all the girls in the county line
 Wait on fate to send a sign
 Who says I can't take time?
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
  
              It’s been a long night in New York City
              It’s been a long night in Austin too
 I don’t remember you looking any better
      But then again I don’t remember you
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
 Who says I can't get stoned?
 Plan a trip to Japan alone
 Doesn't matter if I even go
 Who says I can't get stoned?
  
  
 [Chorus 3]
  
              It’s been a long night in New York City
              It’s been a long time since 22
 I don’t remember you looking any better
 But then again I don't remember you

 [Intro]
  
 Putting my defenses up 
        Cause I don't wanna fall in love 
       If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack 
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
  Never put my love out on the line
                                  Never said yes to the right guy
                                       Never had trouble getting what I want
                                                But when it comes to you I'm never good enough 
  
                   When I don't care
                               I can play him like a Ken doll
                    Won't wash my hair 
                                        Then make him bounce like a basketball 
                                     But you make me wanna act like a girl 
                                  Paint my nails and wear high heels
                                   Yes you make so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

                                  But I cover up, won't let it show 
            So I'm putting my defenses up 
        Cause I don't wanna fall in love 
         If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack 
                              I think I'd have a heart attack
                                 I think I'd have a heart attack

                                        Never break a sweat for the other guys 
                                      When you come around I get paralyzed 
                                   And every time I try to be myself 
                                        It comes out wrong like a cry for help
  
                    It's just not fair 
                                         Brings more trouble than it all is worth
               I gasp for air

                                 I think I'd have a heart attack 
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
  The feelings got lost in my lungs
                          They're burning, I'd rather be numb
              And there's no one else to blame 
                       So scared I'll take off and run
                   I'm flying too close to the sun
                          And I'll burst into flames

 [Verse 1]
  
   Almost heaven,    West Virginia,
   Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
   Life is old there, older than the trees,
 Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
          Country roads, take me home
         To the place I belong:
          West Virginia, mountain momma,
          Take me home, country roads.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
    All my mem'ries,    gather 'round her,
    Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
    Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
    Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
          Country roads, take me home
         To the place I belong:

          Take me home, country roads.
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
     I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me,
      The radio reminds me of my home far away.
      And drivin' down the road
          I get a feelin' that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.

 Standard Tuning
  
 The fingerpicking in this song is pretty simple. You just hit the
 bass string once, then pick the E B G strings, the exact notes are
 not important, just do it in the right rhythm.
  
 [Intro]
  
 Here's approximately how the picking goes:
  
       e|---0----0----0-0-0-0--2-2----0---0----0----0-----0---------|
 B|---1----1----1-1-1-1--3-3----0-----0----0----0--------0----|
 G|---0----0----0-0-0-0--2-2----1-------1----1----1----1---1--|
 D|---2----2----2-2-2-2--0-0----2-----------------------------|
 A|---3----3----3-3-3-3---------2-----------------------------|
 E|-----------------------------0-----------------------------|
  
 [Verse 1] [see tab below for picking]
      I met her in a club down in old Soho
             where you drink champagne and it tastes just like coca cola
           C-O-L-A, cola
  
      She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
    I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
           L-O-L-A, Lola,   Lo lo lo lo lola
  
 TAB FOR [VERSE 1] it's impossible to tab out the picking exactly right -
 it seems almost random - but this is as close as I could get
      e|-----0----0----0----0------------0----0--------2----2------|

          e|-----0----0------0-0-0-0--0-2--0----|
 B|-------1----1----1-1-1-1--1-3--0----|  Then the acoustic guitar

 A|--------------------------------11-9----9/11----9h11----11---------|
 E|-------------------------------------12----------------------------|
  
 [Verse 2] and the rest of the song is just strummed. The only thing
 to remember is that the electric guitar sometimes throws in two
 little fills, one on the E chord, and one on the D chord.

 [Verse 2]
       Well I'm not the worlds most physical guy
               but when she squeezed me tight
             she nearly broke my spine, oh my Lola
              Lo lo lo lo Lola
        Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
          why she walked like a woman and talked like a man

              Lo lo lo lo Lola     Lo lo lo lo Lola
  
 [Chorus]
          Well we drank champagne and danced all night
 under electric candlelight
      She picked me up and sat me on her knee
 and said 'Dear boy, won't you come home with me'
  
 [Verse 3]
       Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
             but when I looked in her eye, well I almost fell for my Lola
              Lo lo lo lo Lola   Lo lo lo lo Lola
 Lola,   Lo lo lo lo Lola,  lo lo lo lo Lola
  
 [Bridge]
    I pushed her away
    I walked to the door
    I fell to the floor
    I got down on my knees
       Then I looked at her and she at me
  
 [VERSE 4] [the fingerpicking is pretty much the same as in Verse 1]
      Well that's the way that I want it to stay
        and I always want it to be that way for my Lola
              Lo lo lo lo Lola
 Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
        It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world except for Lola
              Lo lo lo lo Lola
  
 [Chorus]
          Well I left home just a week before
      And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
 Lola smiled and took me by the hand
 and said 'dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man'
  
 [Verse 5]
          Well I'm not the worlds most passionate man
       but I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
            and so is Lola, lo lo lo lo lola      Lo lo lo lo Lola
  
 [Outro]

0,Bella Ciao chords,Bella Ciao – Misc Traditional,"I have noticed there is no tab for the original version of this song, the one brave Italian partisans sang
 during their days of militancy in the Resistance against Nazis and fascists, so I decided to submit one
 myself.
 Bella Ciao means a lot to my country (Italy, of course) as it's widely known as the most famous
 anti-fascist hymn ever sung. However, it has become a symbol of freedom and resistance all over the world,
 it has been translated into several languages and played in different situations and places. That's why I
 think non-Italian speakers too could (and should) enjoy this. We don't exactly know who wrote it, and that
 makes the whole thing even more powerful, I believe.
 As to Italian speakers... the lyrics change according to the website you check, I just tried to put the ones
 that sounded most right/nice to me.

 Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it,
 I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
 I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back
 Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
 Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
 I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

 Save your smile
 Everything fades through time
      I'm lost for words
 Endlessly waiting for you
  
 Stay with me
 Yes I know this cannot be
      As morning comes
       I'll say goodbye to you when I'm done 
              Through the sun

                Guarding your life
  
 [Verse 2]
 I am yours
 Im completely trapped in your soul
 Dazed and confused
 Swept away with your own words
 You're my star
 Invincible,haunting and far
 Grace under fire
 Something is deep in my heart
        In my heart

          Because I'm waiting for you, waiting for this
                  Dream to come true, just to be with you

        In a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
       And that it was a heart that he was stealing
             Oh he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
       The eyes are bright he couldn't wait to get away
    I bet the Juliet was just the icing on the cake
 Make no mistake, no

         And I hope you're holding hands by New Year's Eve
        They made it far too easy to believe

 Bob Dylan
  
 Transcription (and any mistakes) by jwblair@ix.netcom.com
  
 I figured this out a few years back when I bought the video
 ""Don't Look Back"". You see Dylan detune and some fingerings
 when he plays ""Baby Blue"" for Donovan in the hotel. (By the
 way, in ""Don't Look Back"" Dylan capos 2, but Donovan's guitar
 is tuned 1/2 tone below concert, so capo 1 to play along
 with the video.)
  
 Bringing It All Back Home version
 Capo 4, bottom E tuned down to C
  
 Note-> CADGBe
        ++++++
 Cadd4  033010 (add the little finger on the 4th string)
 G      220000 (actually an Em7, but this is what he plays for G)
 Dm     200231 (use the thumb to fret the 6th string)
 E      x22100 (or maybe E7: x22130)
  
 (Note: be sure to strum the 6th string to keep the distinctive
 droning C note going.)
  
  
 [Intro]
  
 (hammering onto the 4th string at the 2nd fret)
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
          But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
 Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
 Crying like a fire in the sun
 Look out the saints are coming through
      And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.
          Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
 The empty-handed painter from your streets
 Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
      The sky, too, is folding under you
      And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home.
          Your empty handed armies, they're all going home.
 The lover who just walked out your door
 Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
 The carpet, too, is moving under you
      And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
 Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you.
          Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you.
 The vagabond who's rapping at your door
 Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
 Strike another match, go start anew
      And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

 Hey there Delilah, what’s it like in New York City?
        I’m a thousand miles away, but girl tonight you look so pretty,
          Yes you do, Times Square can’t shine as bright as you,
               I swear it’s true.
 Hey there Delilah, don’t you worry about the distance,
            I’m right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen,
             Close your eyes, listen to my voice it’s my disguise,
              I’m by your side.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Oh it’s what you do to me, oh it’s what you do to me,
 Oh it’s what you do to me, oh it’s what you do to me,
                 What you do to me.
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard,
             But just believe me girl some day, I'll pay the bills with this guitar,
                We'll have it good, we'll have the life we knew we would,
             My word is good.
 Hey there Delilah, I’ve got so much left to say,
           If every simple song I wrote to you, would take your breath away,
               I’d write it all, even more in love with me you’d fall,
               We’d have it all.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Oh it’s what you do to me, oh it’s what you do to me,
 Oh it’s what you do to me, oh it’s what you do to me,
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 A thousand miles seems pretty far, but they’ve got planes and trains and cars,
 I’d walk to you if I had no other way.
 Our friends would all make fun of us, and we'll just laugh along because,
     We know that none of them have felt this way.
 Delilah I can promise you, that by the time that we get through,
      The world will never ever be the same, and you’re to blame.
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Hey there Delilah you be good, and don’t you miss me,
           Two more years and you’ll be done with school, and I'll be making history,
 Like I do, you’ll know it's all because of you,
 We can do whatever we want to,
 Hey there Delilah here's to you, this one’s for you.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Oh it’s what you do to me, oh it’s what you do to me,
 Oh it’s what you do to me, oh it’s what you do to me,

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
   Maybe I didn’t treat you
   Quite as good as I should have
   Maybe I didn’t love you
   Quite as often as I could have
   Little things I should have said and done
   I just never took the time

   You were always on my mind (you were always on my mind)
           You were always on my mind
  
 [Verse 2]
   Maybe I didn’t hold you
   All those lonely, lonely times
   And I guess I never told you
   I’m so happy that you’re mine
   If I made you feel second best
   Girl, I’m so sorry I was blind

 But now I know the meaning of true love
 I'm kneeling on the everlasting lines

                     I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
 But you're just so cool
 Run your hands through your hair
                  Absent-mindedly making me want you
  
  
 And I don't know how it gets better than this
 You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
 And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
 In a storm in my best dress, fearless
  
  
 So baby drive slow till we run out of road
 In this one horse town
 I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat
 you put your eyes on me
 In this moment now capture it remember it
  
 Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
 You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
 And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
 In a storm in my best dress, fearless
  
 Yea you stood there with me in the doorway
           my hands shake & im not usually this way
 But you pull me in & im a little more brave
         It's a first kiss, it's flawless, really something
       It's fearless
   Ohh..  Yeah
  
 And I don't know how it gets better than this
 You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
 And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
 In a storm in my best dress, fearless
  
   Yeah I don't know how
 Oh.. oh, yeah, yeah

  You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
               Its the morning of your very first day
            You say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
                 Try and stay out of everybodys way
  It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
                For the next four years in this town
                       Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
               You know I haven't seen you around, before
  
  
                      'Cause when you're fifteen and
  Somebody tells you they love you
                    You're gonna believe them
                   And when you're fifteen
      Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
        Well count to ten, take it in
                            This is life before you know who you're gonna be
  At fifteen
  
  
  You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
            And soon enough you're best friends
  Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
             We'll be out of here as soon as we can
        And then you're on your very first date
                   And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying
               And you're momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
                 And you're dancing round your room when the night ends
             When the night ends
  
  
                      'Cause when you're fifteen and
  Somebody tells you they love you
                    You're gonna believe them
                   And when you're fifteen
     And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
       But in your life you'll do things greater than
               Dating the boy on the football team
                But I didnt know it at fifteen
  
  
  When all you wanted was to be wanted
                               Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
  
  
  Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
          But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
        And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
                    Who changed his mind and we both cried
  
  
                      'Cause when you're fifteen and
  Somebody tells you they love you
                    You're gonna believe them
                   And when you're fifteen
     Don't forget to look before you fall
  I've found time can heal most anything
                       And you just might find who you're supposed to be
             I didn't know who I was supposed to be
  At fifteen
  
  
          La la la la la
  La la la la la
  Your very first day, take a deep breath girl
  Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

 Song:Love Story
 Tuning:Capo 2
  
  
 Intro:   
 We were both young when i first saw you
 I close my eyes and the flashback starts
 Im standing there on a balcony of summer air
  
 See the lights, See the party the ball gowns
         I see you make your way through the crowd
            You say hello
                Little did i know
  
             That you were romeo you were throwing pebbles
            And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
              And i was crying on the staircase
    Begging you please don't go, and i said
  
    Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
   I'll be waiting all theres left to do is run
   You'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
   Its a love story baby just say yes
  
   So i sneak out to the garden to see you
   We keep quiet cause we're dead if they know
   So close your eyes
     Escape this town for a little while
              Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
           and my daddy said stay away from Juliet
  
  
           But you were everything to me
              and i was begging you please don't go and i said
  
   Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
   I'll be waiting all theres left to do is run
   You be the prince and i'll be the princess
   Its a love story baby just say yes
  
    Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
    This love is difficult, but its real,
    Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
   Its a love story baby just say yes, oh
  
  
 Solo:   
  
                   I got tired of waiting,   wondering if you were ever coming around
               My faith in you was fading
                           Then i met you on the outskirts of town and i said
    Romeo save me i've been feeling so alone
     I keep waiting for you but you never come
      Is this in my head, i don't know what to think
      He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
    Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone
     I love you and thats all I really know
     I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
   Its a love story baby just say yes
 Oh, oh, yes
           We were both young when i first saw you

  Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceivin'
          But I know I saw a light in you
  And as we walked we were talking
                I didn't say half the things I wanted to
  Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
  I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
  Hey Stephen, boy you might have me believin'
            I don't always have to be alone
  
  
  Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
  Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
  Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
          Can't help it if there's no one else
    Mm I can't help myself
  
  
 (mm mm mm)
  
  Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feelin'
           So I've got some things to say to you
  I've seen it all, so I thought
                          But I've never seen no body shine the way you do
  The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
  It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
  Hey Stephen, why are people always leavin'
           I think you and I should stay the same
  
  
  Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
  Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
  Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
          Can't help it if there's no one else
    Mm I can't help myself
  
  
 (mm mm mm)
  
  
  They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
                   Why aren't you here tonight?
  I'm waiting alone now so come on and come out
              And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
  
  
  Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
        Why I should be the one you choose
  All those other girls, well they're beautiful
       But would they write a song for you? Haha
  
  
  I can't help it if you look like an angel
  Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
  Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
          Can't help it if there's no one else
    Mm I can't help myself
  
  
           If you look like an angel
  Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
  Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
          Can't help it if there's no one else
    Mm I can't help myself, mm myself
  mm mm I can't help myself, I can't help myself, oh oh oh

 The chords aren't really C F Am, but it's easier with short names.
 I think they're Fmaj7, Am7, and I'm not sure about C.
 I hear G played a few different ways, play whichever sounds good to you!
  
 READ THE CHORD CHARTS. THIS IS ACCURATE.
 If you rate it poorly, at least post a correction so I know why.
 Don't tell me the second verse lyrics are wrong, they're not. Buy the CD.
  
  
  
  
  Say you're sorry
          That face of an angel
          Comes out just when you need it to
  As I paced back and forth all this time
              'Cause I honestly believed in you
    Holding on
         The days drag on
          Gsus4 (or 320033)
  Stupid girl,
                                     G* (or 320003)
  I should have known, I should have known
  
  
                   That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
              I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
   Lead her up the stairwell
             This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
            I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
           Now it's too late for you
             And your white horse, to come around
  
  
  Maybe I was naive,
  Got lost in your eyes
        And never really had a chance
  My mistake I didn't know to be in love
               You had to fight to have the upper hand
          I had so many dreams
          About you and me
          Happy endings, now I know
  
  
                   That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
              I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
   Lead her up the stairwell
             This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
            I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
           Now it's too late for you
             And your white horse, to come around
  
  
  And there you are on your knees
  Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
  Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry
  
  
                        'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
             I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
            This is a big world, that was a small town
              There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
           And it's too late for you and your white horse
           Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now
  
  
  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
  Try and catch me now
     Oh, it's too late
  To catch me now

 You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
                                           She's going off about something that you said
                                         'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
 I'm in the room it's a typical Tuesday night
                                                  I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
                                        And she'll never know your story like I do
  
  
      But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
 She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
 Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
                  That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
  
  
               If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
 Been here all along, so why can't you see?
                  You belong with me, you belong with me
  
  
 Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
                                                I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
                                          Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
 Hey isn't this easy
  
  
      And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
                                                     I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
 You say you're fine, I know you better then that
 Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that
  
  
 She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
 Shes cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
 Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
                  That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
  
  
               If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
 Been here all along, so why can't you see?
                  You belong with me
 Standing by and waiting at your back door
 All this time how could you not know, baby
                  You belong with me, you belong with me
  
  
  
                    Oh I remember you drivin' to my house
         In the middle of the night
          I'm the one who makes you laugh
           When you know you're about to cry
        And I know your favorite songs
          And you tell me about your dreams
          Think I know where you belong
          Think I know it's with me
  
  
            Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
 Been here all along, so why can't you see?
                  You belong with me
 Standing by and waiting at your back door
 All this time how could you not know, baby
                  You belong with me, you belong with me
                  You belong with me
                                Have you ever thought just maybe
                  You belong with me, you belong with me

    I see your face in my mind as I drive away

 People are people and sometimes we change our minds

 Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
 It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
              'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
      Now I don't know what to be without you around
  
 PRE-CHORUS
    And we know it's never simple, never easy
    Never a clean break, no one here to save me
 You're the only thing I know, like the back of my hand

 CHORUS
    Breathe   without you, but I have to
    Breathe   without you, but I have to

 Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
 Every little bump in the road I try to swerve
 People are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
 Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
  
 PRE-CHORUS
    And we know it's never simple, never easy
    Never a clean break, no one here to save me
 You're the only thing I know, like the back of my hand
  
 And I can't
  
 CHORUS
    Breathe   without you, but I have to
    Breathe   without you, but I have to
  
 BRIDGE
      It's 2 am, feeling like I just lost a friend
                         Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
      It's 2 am, feeling like I just lost a friend
                           Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me
  
 PRE-CHORUS
    And we know it's never simple, never easy
   Never a clean break, no one here to save me
   Oh,  I can’t...

    Breathe   without you, but I have to
    Breathe   without you, but I have to
 Breathe without you, but I have to

   Sorry, sorry, sorry.

 I couldn't always tell if it was Em and C or
 Em7 and Cadd9 but it really doesn't make a difference,
 just play whatever sounds best and is easiest for you!
  
  
  I took a chance, I took a shot
  And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
  You took a swing, I took it hard
  And down here from the ground I see who you are
  
  
  I'm sick and tired of your attitude
                             I'm feeling like I don't know you
                         You tell me that you love me then cut me down
  And I need you like a heartbeat
                           But you know you got a mean streak
                     Makes me run for cover when you're around
  And here's to you and your temper
           Yes, I remember what you said last night
              And I know that you see what you're doing to me
            Tell me why
  
  
  You could write a book on
                How to ruin someones perfect day
  Well I get so confused and frustrated
       Forget what I'm trying to say, oh
  
  
  I'm sick and tired of your reasons
                      I got no one to believe in
                         You tell me that you want me, then push me around
                          And I need you like a heartbeat
                           But you know you got a mean streak
                     Makes me run for cover when you're around
  And here's to you and your temper
           Yes, I remember what you said last night
              And I know that you see what you're doing to me
            Tell me why
  
  
    Why... do you have to make me feel small
     So you can feel whole inside
 Why... do you have to put down my dreams
     So you're the only thing on my mind
  
  
  I'm sick and tired of your attitude
                             I'm feeling like I don't know you
                         You tell me that you want me then cut down
                               I'm sick and tired of your reasons
                      I got no one to believe in
                      You ask me for my love then you push me around
  Here's to you and your temper
           Yes, I remember what you said last night
              And I know that you see what you're doing to me
            Tell me why, why, tell me why,  ohh
  
  
  I take a step back, let you go
  I told you I'm not bulletproof, now you know

 Song:You're Not Sorry
 Tuning: Capo on 4th
  
 Chords:
  
    e|-2---3---2---0-|   e|-3---3---3---3-|
 B|-3---3---3---2-|   B|-3---3---3---3-| down
 G|-4---0---2---2-|   G|-0---0---0---2-| 1/2
 D|-4---0---0---2-|   D|-2---2---0---0-| step
 A|-2---2---x---0-|   A|-2---3---2---0-|
 E|-2---3---x---0-|   E|-0---x---3---0-|
  
 Yes, I realize it's the same chords for the whole song.
 But I wasn't going to be lazy so I did write out whole thing.
  
 Edit: So I just found a video of Taylor playing this acoustic,
 and she plays it downtuned 1/2 step and plays the other chords
 I added above. I'd recommend the way I originally tabbed it
 for anyone who doesn't want to retune their guitar.
  
  
 All this time I was wasting,
                   Hoping you would come around
            I've been giving out chances every time
                    And all you do is let me down
           And it's taking me this long
 Baby but I figured you out
             And you're thinking we'll be fine again,
      But not this time around
  
  
 You don't have to call anymore
          I won't pick up the phone
              This is the last straw
              Don't wanna hurt anymore
              And you can tell me that you're sorry
        But I don't believe you baby
         Like I did - before
             You're not sorry, no noo no noo
  
  
 Looking so innocent,
    I might believe you if I didn't know
           Could've loved you all my life
         If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
          And you got your share of secrets
          And I'm tired of being last to know
                 And now you're asking me to listen
             Cause it's worked each time before
  
  
      But you don't have to call anymore
          I won't pick up the phone
              This is the last straw
              Don't wanna hurt anymore
              And you can tell me that you're sorry
        But I don't believe you baby
         Like I did - before
             You're not sorry no no ohhh
             You're not sorry no no ohhh
  
  
             You had me falling for you honey
         And it never would've gone away, no
              You used to shine so bright
        But I watched all of it fade
  
  
     So you don't have to call anymore
          I won't pick up the phone
              This is the last straw
                  There's nothing left to beg for
              And you can tell me that you're sorry
        But I don't believe you baby
         Like I did - before
             You're not sorry no no ohhh
             You're not sorry no no ohhh

 He is sensible and so incredible
      And all my single friends are jealous
 He says everything I need to hear and it's like
 I couldn't ask for anything better
 He opens up my door and I get into his car
     And he says you look beautiful tonight
             And I feel perfectly fine
  
  
             But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
           And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
         You're so in love that you act insane
      And that's the way I loved you
 Breakin' down and coming undone
        It's a roller coaster kinda rush
       And I never knew I could feel that much
      And that's the way I loved you
  
  
 He respects my space
      And never makes me wait
      And he calls exactly when he says he will
 He's close to my mother
 Talks business with my father
       He's charming and endearing
          And I'm comfortable
  
  
             But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
           And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
         You're so in love that you act insane
      And that's the way I loved you
 Breakin' down and coming undone
        It's a roller coaster kinda rush
       And I never knew I could feel that much
      And that's the way I loved you
  
  
 He can't see the smile I'm faking
                     And my heart's not breaking
                         'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
      And you were wild and crazy
 Just so frustrating, intoxicating, complicated
 Got away by some mistake and now
  
  
             But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
           And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
      I'm so in love that I acted insane
      And that's the way I loved you
 Breakin' down and coming undone
        It's a roller coaster kinda rush
       And I never knew I could feel that much
      And that's the way I loved you, oh
      And that's the way I loved you, oh
 Never knew I could feel that much
      And that's the way I loved you

 Again, I couldn't always hear the difference between Em/Em7
 and C/Cadd9 etc. but I think I got it pretty close. Enjoy!
  
  
  I’m five years old
                  It’s getting cold
                I’ve got my big coat on
  
  I hear your laugh
                And look up smiling at you
      I run and run
  
  Past the pumpkin patch
                    And the tractor rides up now
        The sky is gold
  I hug your legs and fall asleep
       On the way home
  
  
  I don’t know why all the trees change in the fall
  I know you’re not scared of anything at all
  Don’t know if Snow White’s house is near or far away
                         But I know I had the best day with you today
  
  
  I’m thirteen now
                   And don’t know how my friends
          Could be so mean
  
  I come home crying
            And you hold me tight
        And grab the keys
  
  And we drive and drive
                 Until we’ve found a town
         Far enough away
  
  And we talk and window-shop
          Until I’ve forgotten all their names
  
  I don’t know who I’m gonna talk to now at school
  I know I’m laughing on the car ride home with you
  Don’t know how long it’s gonna take to feel okay
                         But I know I had the best day with you today
  
  
  I have an excellent father
  His strength is making me stronger
  God smiles on my little brother
  Inside and out he’s better than I am
  
  I grew up in a pretty house
              And I had space to run
        And I had the best days with you
  
  
  There is a video
      I found from back when I was three
  You set up a paint set in the kitchen
               And you’re talking to me
  
  It’s the edge of princesses and pirate ships
            And the seven dwarves
  Daddy’s smart and you're the prettiest lady
           In the whole wide world
  
  
  Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""C"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">C</span>  I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
          And I love you for giving me your eyes
 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""G"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">G</span>  Staying back and watching me shine
       And I didn’t know if you knew
           So I’m taking this chance to say
                   That I had the best day with you today

  It's just a sad picture,
  The final blow hits you
  Somebody else gets what you wanted again
  You know it's all the same
  Another time and place
  Repeating history, and your getting sick of it
  
      But I believe in whatever you do
              And I'll do anything to see it through
  
                              Because these things will change
                   Can you feel it now?
                        These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
                It's a revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
                  We'll sing hallelujah
                  We'll sing hallelujah, oh
  
  So we've been outnumbered
  Raided and now cornered
  It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
  We're getting stronger now
  From things they never found
  They might be bigger, but we're faster and never scared
  You can walk away and say we don't need this
                But there's something in your eyes, says we can beat this
  
                            Cause these things will change
                   Can you feel it now?
                        These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
                It's a revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
                  We'll sing hallelujah
                  We'll sing hallelujah
   Oh
  
  Tonight we're standing on our knees
                         To fight for what we worked for all these years
                   The battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
                     Will we stand up champions tonight?
  
                            It was the night things changed
                  Can you see it now?
                        These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
               It's a revolution, throw your hands up, cause we never gave in
                  We'll sing hallelujah
                  We'll sing hallelujah
       Hallelujah

 I don't want a lot for Christmas 
 there is just one thing I need 
 I don't care about the presents 
 underneath the Christmas tree 
 I just want you for my ow n 
 more than you could ever  know 
 Make my wish come  true... 
 All I want for Chris tmas is you

 [Verse 1]
  
 I don't want a lot for Christmas there is just one thing I need 
 I don't care about the presents  underneath the Christmas tree 
 I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace 
 Santa Claus won't make me happy  with a toy on Christmas day

 I just want you for my  own  more than you could ever  know 
 Make my wish come  true...  All I want for  Christmas is you, you, baby

 I won't ask for much this Christmas I won't even wish for snow 
 I'm just gonna keep on waiting  underneath the mistletoe 
 I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick 
 I won't even stay awake to  hear those magic reindeer click

 'Cause I just want you here to night  holding on to me so  tight 
 What more can I  do, baby  All I want for  Christmas is you

 All the lights are shining  brightly everywhere 
 And the sound of children  laughter fills the air 
 and everyone is singing   I hear those s leigh bells ringing 
 Santa won't you bring me the one I really need 
    won't you  please bring my baby to me 
  
  
 [Hook]
  
 Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas this is all I'm asking for

 Why do you always do this to me
 Why couldn't you just see you threw me
 How come you act like this like you just don't care at all

 I can feel, I can feel you baby why

 It's not supposed to hurt this way

 Are you and me still together? Tell me
 You think we can last forever? Tell me...

 By Chris Stapleton
  
 This is a beginner version in the key of G,  Just a simple strum of Up/Down/Down
 sounds good. The D chord over ""Love"" in the last line of the chorus is optional and
 is to be for one beat only. The C G chords that are found together in the chorus after every second
 line are to be played with one down strum each. Or you can pick the open D string, hammer
 the D string 2nd fret then pick open G string, shown below in the second tab. At the of the third
 verse play the D chord in down strums to bring you into the chorus.

 [Intro]
  
 [Chorus]
                 I can still recall, our last summer
 I still see it all
 Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
 Our last summer, memories that remain
  
 [Verse 1]
 We made our way along the river
          And we sat down in the grass by the Eiffel tower
 I was so happy we had met
 It was the age of no regret
   Ohhhh yes
    Those crazy years that was the time
 Of the flower-power
 But underneath
 We had a fear of flying
 Of growing old
 A fear of slowly dying
 We took our chance
                                 Like we were dancing our last dance
  
 [Chorus]
                 I can still recall, our last summer
 I still see it all
   In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame
  
 Our last summer, walking hand in hand
    Paris restaurants, our last summer
     Morning croissants
     Living for the day, worries far away
 Our last summer, we could laugh and play
  
 [Bridge]
 And now you're working in a bank
            A family man, a football fan
 And your name is Harry
 How dull it seems
 Are you the hero of my dreams
  
 [Chorus]
 I can still recall, our last summer
 I still see it all
   In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame
  
 Our last summer, walking hand in hand
 I can still recall, our last summer
 I still see it all
 Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
 Our last summer, memories that remain

 When the road looks rough ahead,
            and your miles and miles from your nice warm bed.

 God knows what is hiding in that weak and drunken heart
              I guess you kissed the girls and made them cry 
        those Hardfaced Queens of misadventure
 God knows what is hiding in those weak and sunken eyes
    a Fiery throng of muted angels
         Giving love and getting nothing back

 People help the people

         No one needs to be alone, oh save me

                        But I'm hoping at the gates,
  
 They'll tell me that you're mine.
 Walking through the city streets
 Is it by mistake or design?
             I feel so alone on a Friday night

 I've put both Am and Am7 as I'm not sure exactly which is the original chord. I
 prefer Am7 when I'm playing with a capo. But it's really down to the individual
 and how you hear it.
  
 To make this a bit more interesting, try hammering on the e when playing the D and
 Am chords. Listen to the song for the timing.

 And I've been a fool and I've been blind
 I can never leave the past behind
  
 I can see no way, I can see no way
 I'm always dragging that horse around
  
 All of his questions, such a mournful sound
                     Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
                So I like to keep my issues strong

 And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back

 It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone
 It's always darkest before the dawn

 Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me
 Looking for heaven, found the devil in me
 Well what the hell I'm gonna let it happen to me

 Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
 Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
 And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
 So shake him off, oh woah
 Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
 Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
 And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
 So shake him off, oh woah

 Early in the mornin'
 Risin' to the street
 Light me up that cigarette and I'll
 strap shoes on my feet
  
 Got to find the reason
 Reason things went wrong
 Got to find the reason
         why my money's all gone
  
 I got a dalmatian
 I can still get high
 I can play the guitar
         Like a motherfuckin' riot

 Life is too short
      So love the one you got
             Cause you might get run over
           or you might get shot
  
 Never start static
           I just get it off my chest
 Never had to battle with my
 bulletproof vest 
  
 Take a small example 
          Take a tip from me
 Take all of your money
       Give it up to charity
  
        Love is what I got 
       Is with in my reach
       the sub rock styles
           dealt straight from Long Beach
  
       It come back to you 
                You're gonna get what you deserve
 Try'n test that 
         Your bound to get served
  
 Love's what I got
         Don't start a riot
          You'll feel it when
                   the dance get's hot

 Love is
          What I got
          I said remember that
 Love is 
          What I got
         Now remember that
  
 Love is
          What I got
          I said remember that
 Love is 
          What I got
         Now remember that
  
 [Verse 3]
 I don't cry 
        When my dog runs away
  
 Don't get angry
             Bout the bills I have to pay
  
 Don't get angry
           when my mom smokes pot
 Hits the bottle 
          and goes right to the rock
  
 Fuck it, fight it
 It's all the same
     Livin with Louey Dog's 
            The only way to stay sane
  
 Let the lovin' 
 Let the lovin come back to me

     Clocks strikes upon the hour, and the sun begins to fade,
   still enough time to figure out how to chase my blues away.
   I've done alright up 'til now, it's the light of day that shows me how,
       and when the night falls, loneliness calls.

 Oh! I wanna dance with somebody, 
 I wanna feel the heat with somebody.
 Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody,

 with somebody who loves me. 
  
 [Verse 2]
 I've been in love and lost my senses, spinning through the town,
 soon or later the fever ends, and I wind up feeling down.
 I need a man who'll take a chance,
       on a love that burns hot enough to last.
       So when the night falls, my lonely heart calls.

 I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow

 For six long years I've been in trouble 
               No pleasures here on earth I found 
                                 For in this world I'm bound to ramble 
            I have no friends to help me now.

 [Verse 3]
  
 It's fare thee well my old lover

                                      For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad

 You can bury me in some deep valley 
           For many years where I may lay 
                              Then you may learn to love another 
             While I am sleeping in my grave.

 [Verse 5]
  
 Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger 
                 My face you'll never see no more. 
                                   But there is one promise that is given 
                I'll meet you on God's golden shore.

           And your Volvo lights lit up green and white
           With the cities on the signs
          But you held your course to some distant war
         In the corners of your mind

          Did you hear the notes, all those static codes
         In the radio abyss?

                          Thought I'd end up with Sean
                  But he wasn't a match
                         Wrote some songs about Ricky

 [Verse]
  
   Story of my life
 Searching for the right
 But it keeps avoiding me
 Sorrow in my soul
   'Cause it seems that one
   Really loves my company
   He's more than a man
   And this is more than love
       The reason that the sky is blue
       But clouds are rollin' in
    Because I'm gone again
      And to him I just can't be true
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
  /               And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
         And it kills him inside

        With some other guy
        /
 I can see him dyin'

    I don't wanna do this anymore
    I don't wanna be the reason why
  /            Everytime I walk out the door
  I see him die a little more inside
 /              I don't wanna hurt him anymore
    I don't wanna take away his life
 /        /     I don't wanna be...
    /     A murderer
  
  
 [Verse]
  
    I feel it in the air
      As I'm doin' my hair
      Preparing for another date
     A kiss upon my cheek
      As he reluctantly
     Accepts i'm gonna be out late
    I say I won't belong
        Just hangin' with the girls
    A lie I didn't have to tell
     Because we both know
         Where I'm about to go
 And we know it very well

 [Verse 1]
  
        Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
      or, darling, have you started feeling old yet?
        Don't worry, I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
                   with the efficiency that only youth can harness.
            And do you still think love is a laserquest?
       Or do you take it all more seriously?
                 I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had,
                  but you're always busy being make-believe.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
      And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there?
            Or have somebody's good-night kisses got that covered?
                                  When I'm not being honest, I'll pretend that you were just some lover.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Now I can't think of there without thinking of you,
   I doubt that comes as a surprise.
       And I can't think of anything to dream about,
 I can't find anywhere to hide.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
            And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
            and I convince myself I need another.
                                        And for a minute it gets easier to pretend that you were just some lover.

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
   I like to say we gave it a try
   I like to blame it all on life
   Maybe we just weren’t right
      But that’s a lie, that’s a lie
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
      And we can deny it as much as we want
         But in time our feelings will show
        Cause sooner or later
        We'll wonder why we gave up
      The truth is everyone knows
  
  
 [Chorus]
 Almost, almost is never enough
 So close to being in love
     If I would have known that you wanted me
            The way I wanted you
       Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
      But right here in each others arms
  
         And we almost, we almost knew what love was
      But almost is never enough
  
  
 [Verse 2]
   If I could change the world overnight
   There'd be no such thing as goodbye
   You'll be standing right where you were
 We'd get the chance we deserve

 Hello,
                   is there anybody in there? 
       Just nod if you can hear me;
           is there anyone home? 
  
  
 Come on, now,
                I hear you're feeling down.
        Well, I can ease your pain;
          get you on your feet again.
  
 Relax,
                   I need some information first.
 Just the basic facts:
          can you show me where it hurts? 
  
 There is no pain, you are receding.
 A distant ships smoke on the horizon.
 You are only coming through in waves.
       Your lips move but I can't hear what you re saying.
       When I was a child I had a fever.
     My hands felt just like two balloons.
 Now I got that feeling once again;
                       I can't explain, you would not understand.
                    This is not how I am.
 I  have become, comfortably numb.
  
  
 I  have become, comfortably numb.
  
 Ok, (ok)
                just a little pinprick. 
                        There'll be no more --aaaaaahhhhh!
              But you may feel a little sick.
  
  
 Can you stand up?
                    I do believe it's working good.
                   That'll keep you going for the show.
               Come on it's time to go.
  
 There is no pain, you are receding.
 A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
 You are only coming through in waves.
       Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
       When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
 out of the corner of my eye.
    I turned to look but it was gone.
                         I cannot put my finger on it now.
                          The child is grown, the dream is gone.
 I  have become, comfortably numb.

 Olha, que coisa mais linda, Mais cheia de graça,
 É ela, menina, que vem e que passa

         a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar

 the 21st night of September?
 Love was changing the minds of pretenders
 While chasing the clouds away

 As we danced in the night,

           Man, we stepping out like woa (Oh God!), cameras point and shoot
            Ask me 'what's my best side?', I stand back and point at you, you
 You the one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
 But, the grass ain't always greener on the other side, it's green where you water it
 So I know, we got issues baby, true, true, true
 But I'd rather work on this you than to go ahead and start with someone new
 As long as you love me
  
 [Chorus]
                  As long as you love me 
                We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
                  As long as you love me
                 I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold

      But last night I look up into the dark half of the blue, and they've gone backwards.
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 Something in your magnetism must have pissed them off
 Forcing them to get an early night
 I have been searching from the bottom to the top for such a sight
        As the one I caught when I saw your 
  
  
 [Chorus]

 [Verse]
  
 Nobody I asked knew how he came to be the one to whom you surrendered.
 Any man who wasn't led away into the other room stood pretending
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 That something in your magnetism hadn't just made him drop
 Whoever's hand it was that he was holding
 I have been searching from the bottom to the top for such a sight

         But my feet got caught in the middle
        And I thought Id seen the light
            But oh no, 
    I was just stuck on the puzzle

 Ano na kayang balita sa iyo? Iniisip mo rin kaya ako?
  
 Simula nang ika'y mawala, wala nang dahilan para lumuha
   Damdaming pilit ko nang tinatago
   Hinahanap ka parin ng aking puso
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
   Parang kulang nga
   Kapag ika'y wala
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
      At hiling sa mga bituin, Na minsan pa sana ako'y iyong mahalin
    Hihiling kahit dumilim, Ang aking daan na tatahakin patungo
    Alaala mong tinangay na ng hangin, Sa langit ko na lamang ba yayakapin
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus 2]
  
   Nasaan ka na kaya?
     Aasa ba sa wala?
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
  
        At hihilig sa mga bituin, Na minsan pa sana ako'y iyong mahalin
         Hihiling kahit dumilim, Ang aking daan na tatahakin patungo sa iyo
    Patungo sa iyo
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
    Ipipikit ko ang aking mga mata,
                  Dahil nais ka lamang mahagkan, Nais ka lamang masilayan
         Dahil alam kong tapos na, Dahil alam kong wala ka na
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
  
        At hihilig sa mga bituin, Na minsan pa sana ako'y iyong mahalin
         Hihiling kahit dumilim, Ang aking daan na tatahakin patungo sa iyo
    Patungo sa iyo
   Patungo sa iyo, patungo sa'yo

 [Intro]
  
 |   
  
 [Verse]
  
 I've gotta take a little time, a little time to think things over.
 I better read between the lines, in case I need it when I'm older.
  
 Now, this mountain I must climb feels like the world upon my shoulders.
 Through the clouds I see love shine.  It keeps me warm as life grows colder.
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
        In my life there's been heartache and pain.
    I don't know if I can face it again.
  Can't stop now.  I've travelled so far to change this lonely life.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   I want to know what love is.       I want you to show me.
   I want to feel what love is.       I know you can show me.
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 I'm gonna take a little time, a little time to look around me.
 I've got nowhere to hide.  It looks like love has finally found me.
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
        In my life there's been heartache and pain.
    I don't know if I can face it again.
  Can't stop now.  I've travelled so far to change this lonely life.
  
  
 [Chorus] (x5)
  
   I want to know what love is.       I want you to show me.
   I want to feel what love is.       I know you can show me.

 [Verse 1]
 I never came to the beach, or stood by the ocean
 I never sat by the shore, under the sun with my feet in the sand
                  But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
        'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
 I always thought I would sink, so  I  ne - ver swam
    I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
      And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
  
 [Chorus]
             But here I am,  next to you
             The sky is more blue  in Malibu
          Next to you  in Malibu
          Next to you
  
 [Verse 2]
 We watched the sun go down as we were walking
 I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
 You would explain the current, as  I  just smiled
 Hoping I just stay the same, and nothing will change
               And it'll be us, just for a while. Do we even  exist?
             That's when  I  make the wish, to swim away with the fish
     Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
 I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
      I'd be here writing this song
  
 [Chorus]
             But here I am,  next to you
             The sky is so blue  in Malibu
          Next to you  in Malibu

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
 There was a time
       when I was alone
 Nowhere to go
         and no place to call home
 My only friend was the man in the moon
      and even sometimes he would go away too
 Then one night as I close my eyes
 I saw a shadow flying high
 he came to me
           with the sweetest smile
 told me he wanted to talk for awhile
         He said Peter Pan that's what they call me.
   I promise that you'll never be lonely.
      And ever since that day
  
  
 [Chorus]
   I am a lost boy from Neverland
 Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
   And when we're bored we play in the woods
 Always on the run from Captain Hook
 Run, run, lost boy they say to me
   Away from all of reality
 Neverland is home to lost boys like me
      And lost boys like me are free
  
  
 [Verse 2]
     He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
    Believe in him, and believe in me
    Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
 To your beautiful destiny
        As we soared above the town that never loved me
    I realized I finally had a family
 Soon enough we reached Neverland
 Peacefully my feet hit the sand
      And ever since that day
  
  
 [Chorus]
   I am a lost boy, from Neverland
 Usually hangin' out with Peter Pan
   And when we're bored we play in the woods
 Always on the run from Captain Hook
 Run, run, lost boy they say to me
   Away from all of reality
 Neverland is home to lost boys like me
      And lost boys like me are free
 Neverland is home to lost boys like me
      And lost boys like me are free

 Peter Pan, Tinkerbell, Wendy Darling,
 Even Captain Hook, you are my perfect storybook
 Neverland I love you so, you are now my home sweet home
     Forever a lost boy at last
          And for always I will say
  
  
 [Chorus]
   I am a lost boy from Neverland
 Usually hangin' out with Peter Pan
   And when we're bored we play in the woods

 [INTRO]
  
 [VERSE]
 I met you in the dark
 you lit me up
 you made me feel as though
 i was enough
  
 we danced the night away
 we drank too much
 i held your hair back when
 you were throwing up
  
 [PRE-CHORUS]
 And then you smiled over your shoulder
 for a minute i was stone cold sober
 i pulled you closer to my chest
  
 And then you asked me to stay over
 i said i already told you
 i think that you should get some rest
  
 [CHORUS]
 I knew i loved you then
 but you'll never know
 cause i played it cool when i
 was scared of letting go
 I knew i needed you 
 but i've never shown
 and i wanna stay with you
 until we're grey and old
 just say you wont let go
 just say you wont let go
  
 [VERSE]
 I wake you up with some
 breakfast in bed
 I'll bring you coffee
 and kiss on your head
  
 I'll take the kids to school
 wave them goodbye
 and i'll thank my lucky stars
 for that night
  
  
 [PRE-CHORUS]
 when you looked over your shoulder
 for a minute i forget that i'm older
 i wanna dance with you right now
  
 and you look is beautiful as ever
 and i swear that everyday you'll get better 
 you make me feel this way somehow
  
 [CHORUS]
 Im so in love with you
 and i hope you know
 darling your love is more 
 than worth its weight in gold
 we've come so far my dear
 look how we've grown
 i want to stay with you
 until we're grey and old
 just say you wont let go
     just say you wont let go
  
 [VERSE]
 I wanna live with you
 even when we're ghosts
 cause you were always there for me 
 when i needed you most 
  
 [CHORUS]
 cause im gonna love you till
 my lungs give out
 i promise till death we part
 like in our vows
 So i wrote this song for you
 now everybody knows 
 that it's just you and me
 until we're grey and old
 just say you wont let go
     just say you wont let go

              The way she moves I never doubt her
           When she talks she somehow creeps into my dreams
          She's a doll, a catch, a winner
         I'm in love and no beginner

        Through the night
          Baby, stand here holding my sides
            Close your baby blue eyes
       Every moment feels right
       And I may feel like a fool

 This is a brilliant composition by Axis Of Awesome, I thought I'd tab this version,
 it has more songs, and its also more challenging than the CD
 version.
  
 Note: There is a tricky change in chord structure after ""save tonight"".
  
 Enjoy!
  
  
 My life is brilliant, my love is pure.
 I saw an angel, of this I'm sure.
  
 Forever young, I wanna
 be forever young.
 I won't hesitate no more,
      no more, it cannot wait, I'm yours.
 This is the way you left me,
 I'm not pretending,
 No hope, no love, no glory,
 No Happy ending.
 Cause you are amazing,
 We did amazing, things.
             If I could, then I would,
 I'll go wherever you will, (go)
 Can you feel, the love tonight?
          And she will, be loved,
           Yeah she will, be loved.
              Pictures of you, pictures of me,
               up upon your wall for the world to see.
                'cause I cant live, with or without you.
           And if I fall, at your feet.
                  You'll let your tears, am I not pretty enough,
        is my heart too broken.

           We'll be ridin' on the horses, yeah yeah.
 No woman, no cry,
     It surely is a dream,
                  I come from the land down under.
 Once a jolly swagman, camped by a billabong.
 Take on me,(When I come around)
 Take Me On,(When I come around)
 I'll be gone
             In a day or, two.
 Save tonight,   (Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you.)
 Fight the break of dawn.
      Come tommorow,  (There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do.)
    tommorow I'll be gone.

  I know she's playin with me,
  But thats okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem.

         'Cause I'm not here for your entertainment,
   you don't really wanna mess with me tonight.
  Cant read my, cant read my, no he can't read my,
 poker face, come on Barbie lets go party.
 Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me.
  She wants to touch me (woo-hoo),
                            She wants to love me (woo-hoo),
                             She'll never leave me (woo-hoo-oh-oh-oh).
    Control yourself,  take only what you need from it.
 Take your canvas bags, take your canvas bags,

 Take your canvas bags.

 Capo on 3rd fret
  
 This song is actually much simpler than the other ways up here. I watched some live videos
 and the guitar player plays this song with a capo on the 3rd fret. Since the guitar is so quiet
 it’s kind of hard to tell exactly what he’s playing, so I kind of just followed the bass.
 For playing by yourself on an acoustic guitar this works perfectly.

          In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
     At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines
  
 Sprung from cages on highway 9, chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected
      and steppin' out over the line, whoah!
 Baby this town rips the bones from your back
         It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap, we gotta get out while we're young
         'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run

        Wendy let me in, I wanna be your friend, I want to guard your dreams and visions
       Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims, and strap your hands across my engines
  
    Together we could break this trap, we'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back, whoah!
           Will you walk with me out on the wire? 'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
        But I gotta find out how it feels

 [Verse 1]
  
         Well I started out,
         Down a dirty road.
 Started out,
 All alone.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
          And the sun went down,
       as I crossed the hill.
          And the town lit up, 
      the world got still.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
      I'm learning to fly,
        but I aint got wings.
 coming down,
         is the hardest thing.
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
            Well the ""Good old days""
      May not return.
          And the rocks might melt,
          and the sea may burn.

      for God knows where.
    I guess I'll know,

 [Verse]
  
   There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard
   No song that I could sing But I can try for your heart
   Our dreams, and they are made out of real things
         Like a, shoebox of photographs With sepiatone loving
   Love is the answer, At least for most of the questions in my heart
   Like why are we here? And where do we go? and how come it's so hard?
   It's not always easy and Sometimes life can be deceiving
   I'll tell you one thing it's always better when we're together
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
       MMM it's always better when we're together
       Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together
       Well, it's always better when we're together
       Yeah, it's always better when we're together
  
  
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
                    And all of these moments Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
         But I know that they'll be gone When the morning light sings
                   And brings new things      For tomorrow night you see
           That they'll be gone too Too many things I have to do
                       But if all of these dreams might find their way Into my day to day scene
          I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between
             With only two Just me and you Not so many things we got to do 
       Or places we got to be We'll Sit beneath the mango tree now
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
       Yeah, it's always better when we're together
       MMM, we're somewhere in between together
       Well, it's always better when we're together
       Yeah, it's always better when we're together

                Hey now, and      and when I waaaake up,You look so pretty, sleeping next to me
               But there is    not enough time,
               And there is no, no song I could sing
               And there is no,    combination of words I could say
              But I will still, tell you one thing We're better together.

 It was always me and you
 Shaken up and shippin' out
 Check me in and check me out

 You can tell me what you see
 I will choose what I believe

 [Verse 1]
  
 If you could read my mind love
 What a tale my thoughts could tell
 Just like an old time movie
 'bout a ghost from a wishin' well
 In a castle dark or a fortress strong
       With chains upon my feet
      You know that ghost is me
      And I will never be set free
     As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 If I could read your mind love
 What a tale your thoughts could tell
 Just like a paperback novel
 The kind that drugstores sell
 When you reach the part where the heartaches come
      The hero would be me
      But heroes often fail
      And you won't read that book again
     Because the ending's just too hard to take
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 I'd walk away like a movie star
           Who gets burned in a three way script
 Enter number two
    A movie queen to play the scene
     Of bringing all the good things out in me
 But for now love, let's be real
      * I never thought I could act this way *
           And I've got to say that I just don't get it
 I don't know where we went wrong
          But the feelin's gone
        And I just can't get it back
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
 If you could read my mind love
 What a tale my thoughts could tell
 Just like an old time movie
 'bout a ghost from a wishin' well
 In a castle dark or a fortress strong
       With chains upon my feet
      But stories always end
      And if you read between the lines
         You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand
      The feelin's that you lack
    I never thought I could feel this way
           And I've got to say that I just don't get it
 I don't know where we went wrong
 But the feelin's gone
        And I just can't get it back

 [Verse 1]
  
 This ain't a song for the brokenhearted
     No silent prayer for faith departed
 I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
               You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 It's  my life
       It's now or never
                I ain't gonna live forever

   Billy Ray was a preacher's son
                And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
 When they'd gather 'round and started talking
 That's when Billy would take me walking
 A-through the back yard we'd go walking
 Then he'd look into my eyes
 Lord knows to my surprise
  
 [Chorus]

   Being good isn't always easy
                No matter how hard I'd try
 When he started sweet-talkin' to me
 He'd come and tell me everything is all right
 He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right
 Can I get away again tonight

 Tellin' me that he's all mine

 Lookin' to see how much we've grown

 [Verse]
  
                 It starts with one thing I don't know why
     It doesn't even matter how hard you try
 Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
     To explain in due time
  
           All I know, time is a valuable thing
 Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
 Watch it count down to the end of the day
           The clock ticks life away
  
            It's so unreal, didn't look out below
 Watch the time go right out the window
 Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
     Or wasted it all just to 
  
            Watch you go, I kept everything inside
      And even though I tried, it all fell apart
 What it meant to me will eventually be
     A memory of a time when
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
             I tried so hard and got so far
             But in the end it doesn't even matter
           I had to fall to lose it all
             But in the end it doesn't even matter
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 One thing, I don't know why
     It doesn't even matter how hard you try
 Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
     To remind myself how
  
             I tried so hard, in spite of the way you were mocking me
                                       Acting like I was part of your property
                                            Remembering all the times you fought with me
  
                          I'm surprised it got so far
                                       Things aren't the way they were before
                                       You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
                                     Not that you knew me back then but it all comes back to me 
  
         In the end you kept everything inside
           And even though I tried, it all fell apart
 What it meant to me will eventually be
         A memory of a time when
  
  
 [Chorus]

               And for all this 
               There's only one thing you should know
  
              I've put my trust in you
            Pushed as far as I can go
               And for all this

 I don't stand in line, I don't pay for clubs, fuck that

 [Verse 1] (Willie Nelson)
  
    I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride
   With sword and pistol by my side
    Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
    Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
    The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty five
      But I am still alive
  
  
 [Verse 2] (Kris Kristofferson)
  
    I was a sailor, I was born upon the tide
   With the sea, I did abide
    I sailed a schooner round the horn to Mexico
    I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
    And when the yards broke off, they said that I got killed
      But I am living still

    I was a dam builder, across a river deep and wide
   Where steel and water did collide

    They buried me in that gray tomb that knows no sound

 [Verse 1]
                It's close to midnight, and something evil's, lurking in the dark.
            Under the moonlight, you see a sight, that almost stops your heart.
             You try to scream, but terror takes the sound, before you make it.
               You start to freeze, as horror looks you right between the eyes;
              You're para-lyzed.
  
 [Chorus 1]

      And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike.

               You hear the door slam, and realise there's nowhere left to run.
               You feel the cold hand, and wonder if you'll ever see the sun.
                 You close your eyes, and hope that this is just imagi-nation.
              But all the while, you hear the creature creepin' up be-hind;
                You're out of time.
  
 [Chorus 2]

  Darkness falls across the land, the midnight hour is close at hand.

 [Verse]
   You are my sweetest downfall
   I loved you first, I loved you first
     Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth
    I have to go, I have to go
                Your hair was long, when we first met
  
 [Chorus]
 Samson went back to bed
 Not much hair left on his head
      He ate a slice of wonder bread and went right back to bed
      And history books forgot about us and the bible didn't mention us
          And the bible didn't mention us, not even once
  
 [Verse]
   You are my sweetest downfall
   I loved you first, I loved you first
   Beneath the stars came fallin' on our heads

                Your hair was long when we first met
  
 [Chorus]
 Samson came to my bed
 Told me that my hair was red
 Told me I was beautiful and came into my bed
       Oh I cut his hair myself one night
     A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light
          And he told me that I'd done alright
       and kissed me 'til the mornin' light, the mornin' light
         and he kissed me 'til the mornin' light

 Wish I could be there for ya, give me a reason to go
  
 Every time I'm walkin' out, I can hear you tellin' me to turn around
 Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down
  
 Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh
 I know you're scared of the unknown (-Known)
  
 You don't wanna be alone (Alone)
 I know I always come and go (And go)

 Take me on a date
  
 I deserve it babe
 And don't forget the flowers every anniversary
 'Cause if you'll treat me right
 I'll be the perfect wife
 Buying groceries
  
 Buy-buying what you need
 You got that 9 to 5
  
 But, baby, so do I
 So don't be thinking I'll be home and baking apple pies
 I never learned to cook
 But I can write a hook
 Sing along with me
  
 Sing-sing along with me (hey)

    Arrive at seven the place feels good
    No time to call you today
    Encores till eleven then Chinese food
    Back to the hotel again

    I call your number the line ain't free
    I'd like to tell you come to me
    A night without you   seems like a lost dream
    Love I can't tell you how I feel

   And here's to you Mrs Robinson
 Jesus loves you more than you will know (wo wo wo)

 Heaven holds a place for those who pray

       We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
 Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes
 Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home

 Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
 It's a little secret just the Robinson's affair
 Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids
  
  
 [Chorus]
 Coo coo ca-choo, Mrs Robinson
 Jesus loves you more than you will know (wo wo wo)

                                         Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
 Going to the candidates' debate
 Laugh about it, shout about it
 When you've got to choose
 Every way you look at it, you lose
  
  
 [Chorus]
 Where have you gone Joe Dimaggio?
 A nation turns its lonely eyes to you (woo woo woo)
                  What's that you say Mrs Robinson?
 Joltin' Joe has left and gone away

   away with the aching part of me.

    I walk a lonely road
      The only one that I have ever known
             Don't know where it goes
 But it's home to me and I walk alone
  
    I walk this empty street
 On the boulevard of broken dreams
            Where the city sleeps
      And I'm the only one and I walk alone
   I walk alone, I walk alone
   I walk alone, I walk a-
  
 [Chorus]
   My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
   My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
   Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
   Till then I'll walk alone

 and strong and waited for the world to come along
 swears she knew it now she swears he's gone

          With a surge of that well-known sadness
 And I have to sit down for a while

 Barely awake
 I let precious time go by

 And a sense of guilt I can't deny

          What happened to the wonderful adventures

 Are you mine?

 She's a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
 N.C.
 In my mind when she's not right there beside me

          And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
      And I can't help myself, all I wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine? ""

          Are you mine?     (Or just mine tonight?)

 [Pre-chorus]
  
           And you know one of these days when I get my money right
           Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life

  Meet you downstairs
         in the bar and hurt
       your rolled up sleeves
           in your skull t-shirt.
           You say, ""What did you do
       with him today?""

  This is when

  Run out to meet
 your chips and pitta.

    I cried for you
         on the kitchen floor.

 [INTRO: riff-1]
  
  
  
 [1st VERSE: riff-1]
  
 Mama, she has taught me well
 Told me when I was young
 Son, your life's an open book
        Don't close it 'fore it's done
      The brightest flame burns quickest
     Is what I heard her say
    A son's heart sewed to mother
      But I must find my way
  
  
 [CHORUS: riff-2]
  
 Let my heart go
 Let your son grow
        Mama, let my heart go
     Or let this heart be still
  
  
 [2nd VERSE: riff-1]
  
 Rebel my new last name
 Wild blood in my veins
 Apron strings around my neck
      The mark that still remains
 Left home at an early age
     Of what I heard was wrong
    I never asked forgiveness
      But what is said is done
  
  
 [CHORUS: riff-2]
  
 (last line ends on Asus4 instead of Asus2)
  
 Let my heart go
 Let your son grow
        Mama, let my heart go
     Or let this heart be still
  
  
 [BRIDGE: riff-3]
  
 Never I ask of you
      But never I gave
          But you gave me your emptiness
        I now take to my grave
 Never I ask of you
      But never I gave
          But you gave me your emptiness
         I now take to my grave
     So let this heart be still
  
  
 [3rd VERSE: riff-1]
  
 Mama, now I'm coming home
          I'm not all you wished of me
    A mother's love for her son
 Spoken, help me be
          Well, I took your love for granted
              And all the things you said to me
    I need your arms to welcome me
         But, a cold stone's all I see
  
  
 [CHORUS: riff-1]
  
 (last line ends on Asus4 instead of Asus2):
  
 Let my heart go
 Let your son grow
        Mama, let my heart go
     Or let this heart be still
  
  
 [CHORUS: riff-1]
  
 Let my heart go
        Mama, let my heart go
            You never let my heart go
     So let this heart be still
  
  
 [ENDING: riff-3]
  
 (last line fades out on Am):
  
 Never I ask of you
      But never I gave
          But you gave me your emptiness
        I now take to my grave
 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""Dm"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Dm</span> Never I ask of you
      But never I gave

        Guess mine is not the first heart broken
     My eyes are not the first to cry
      I'm not the first to know there's just no gettin' over you

 Your gift keeps on giving
 What is this I'm feeling?
 If you want to leave, I'm with it

 To give up who we are
 So let's raise the bar
 And our cups to the stars

 [Verse 1]
  
 Have you got colour in your cheeks?
 Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type that sticks around like something in your 
 teeth?
 Are there some aces up your sleeve?
 Have you no idea that you're in deep?
 I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
 How many secrets can you keep?
      Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
 Until I fall asleep
 Spilling drinks on my settee
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
     Do I wanna know
 if this feeling flows both ways?
   Sad to see you go
 Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
   Baby we both know
 That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
  
 [Chorus]
  
     Crawlin' back to you
  C­   Am
 Ever though of calling when you've had a few
 Cos I always do
  
 Maybe I'm too
    busy being yours to fall for somebody new
      Now I've thought it through
 Crawlin' back to you
  
 [Verse 2]
  
   So have you got the guts?
 Been wondering if you're heart's still open
  
 And if so I wanna know what time it shuts
 Simmer down and pucker up
     I'm sorry to interrupt
      It's just I'm constantly on the cusp
     CAm
 Of trying to kiss you
 I don't know if you feel the same as I do
 But we could be together if you wanted to
 .

    Heading for the city lights in 1975

    The scent of a lemon drips from your eyes
