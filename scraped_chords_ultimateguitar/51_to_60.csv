0,You Need Me I Dont Need You chords,You Need Me I Dont Need You – Ed Sheeran,"[Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
 But now I'm in town, break it down
  
 Thinking of making a new sound
 Playing a different show every night
  
 In front of a new crowd
 That's you now, hello, ciao
  
 Seems that life is great now
 See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
 I can't, no, I won't hush
                                   I'll say the words that make you blush
                      I'm gonna sing this now,  ow ow
 See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
 I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
 I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
 Let me sing and do my thing
 And move to greener pastures
 See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
 I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
 I won't stay put
  
 Give me the chance to be free
 Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
  
 [Chorus]
 Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you at all
           You need me, man, I don't need you
  
 You need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you at all
           You need me
  
 [Verse 2]
 I sing and write my own tune
  
 and I write my own verse
        Hell, don't need another wordsmith
  
 to make the tune sell?
 Call yourself a singer-writer
  
 You're just bluffing
 Your name's on the credits
           And you didn't write nothing
 I sing fast
  
 I know that all my shit's cool
 I will blast
  
 And I didn't go to Brit School
 I came fast with the way I act, right
 I can't last, if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
 I won't be a product of my genre
 My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
 Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
 Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
 And musically I'm demonstrating
 When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
 Times at The Enterprise when some fella filmed me
 A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi
  
 [Chorus]
 Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you at all
           You need me, man, I don't need you
  
 You need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you at all
           You need me
 [Verse 3]
 All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
          Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
       Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
 Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
                                            All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
                   To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
 Hey, so I keep singing that
 When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
 Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
 And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
 And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
 Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
 Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
 I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
 With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
 So see the signs, stand to the side
  
 Open your eyes and take a look and realize
  
 The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
 I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar
 Urban Angel rising from the ashes
 Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
 Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
 Into having sex, I ain't into making love
 Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
          You can find me in the club club, bottle full of bubbly
 Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
 Into having sex, I ain't into making love
 Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
  
 [Chorus]
 Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you at all
           You need me, man, I don't need you
  
 You need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you at all
           You need me, man, I don't need you
  
 [Bridge]
 My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
 My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
 My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
 My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning
  
  
 [Verse 4]
 Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
 A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
 Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
 Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
 Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
 One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
 One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
 Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
 But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
 And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
 Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
 Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
 Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
 Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
 Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
 I blaze high grade weed all the time!
  
 [Bridge]
 Now my eyes are red
                                    Cause you need me, I don't need you
                                 You need me man, my eyes are red
                                 You need me man, I don't need you at all
           You need me man, my eyes are red
                                 And you need me, I don't need you
                                You need me man, my eyes are red
                                 You need me man, I don't need you at all
           You need me man, I don't need you

 [Interlude] Same chord progression (  
 Woooah
 Woooah
 Woooah
 Yea
  
 [Verse 5]
                                Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
                                 I won't stop till my name's in lights
  
 At stadium heights with Damien Rice
         On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
              Because I'm young and all my brother's gonna give me advice
       Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
 Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
 The game's over but now I'm on a new level
 Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
 People think that I'm bound to blow up
 I've done around about a thousand shows
        But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
     So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out, Wow
 From day one, I've been prepared
       With V05 wax for my ginger hair
             So now I'm back to the sofa, giving a dose of what the future holds
              'Cause it's another day
  
 [Verse 6]
 Rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
 I'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know
 On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
 If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
 My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
 Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
 Do it for the hell of it
                               Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
 I took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image
 Put in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick
 The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
 Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
 But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
 World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
 Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
     I'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing
  
 I'm back to sing this
  
 [Chorus]
 Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you at all
           You need me, man, I don't need you
  
 You need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you at all
           You need me, man, I don't need you
  
 [Verse 7]
                   Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
           Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
      And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
       Into another rappers shoes using new laces
 Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
 Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
        Nationwide tour with just jack, still had to get the bus back
 Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
    I hit back when the pen hurts me
      I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
      I'm still the same as a year ago
  
 But more people hear me though
 According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
      I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
 Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
 Melody music maker
  
 Reading all the papers
 They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator.
  
 [Chorus]
 Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you at all
           You need me, man, I don't need you
  
 You need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you
                                 You need me, man, I don't need you at all
           You need me, man, I don't need you

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
 Walking down 29th and Park
 I saw you in another’s arms
 Only a month we’ve been apart
            You look happier
 Saw you walk inside a bar
 He said something to make you laugh
 I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
                 Yeah, you look happier, you do
  
 [Pre-chorus 1]
 Ain’t nobody hurt you like I hurt you
       But ain’t nobody love you like I do
 Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
 If you’re moving on with someone new
  
 [Chorus 1]
                       Cause baby you look happier, you do
                      My friends told me one day I’d feel it too
                      And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
                    But I know I was happier with you
  
 [Verse 2]
 Sat on the corner of the room
 Everything’s reminding me of you
 Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you’re happier
 Aren’t you?
  
 [Pre-Chorus 2]
 Ain’t nobody hurt you like I hurt you
       But ain’t nobody need you like I do
 I know that there’s others that deserve you
          But my darling, I am still in love with you
  
 [Chorus 2]
                       But I guess you look happier, you do
                         My friends told me one day I’ll  feel it too
                  I could try to smile to hide the truth

 [Verse 1]
  
 My head is stuck in the clouds
 She begs me to come down
       Says ""Boy quit foolin' around""
 I told her ""I love the view from up here
 The warm sun and wind in my ear
        We'll watch the world from above
        As it turns to the rhythm of love""
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
         We may only have tonight
               But till the morning sun you're mine, all mine
           Play the Music low and sway to the rhythm of love
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 My heart beats like a drum
 A guitar string to the strum
       A beautiful song to be sung
            She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
 That roll back when she's laughing at me
      She rises up like the tide
      The moment her lips meet mine
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
         We may only have tonight
               But till the morning sun you're mine, all mine
           Play the Music low and sway to the rhythm of love
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 When the moon is low
 We can dance in slow motion
 And all your tears will subside
 All your tears will dry
  
  
  
  
 And long after I've gone
 You'll still be humming along
      And I will keep you in my mind

  Friday night beneath the stars
                            In a field behind your yard
            You and I are painting pictures in the sky
  And sometimes we don't say a thing
                                Just listen to the crickets sing
         Everything I need is right here by my side

        Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground

           Well you drive me crazy half the time

 Let you know that what I feel is true

  And I don't try to hide my tears

 She knows exactly how to tantalize
 She's out to get you, danger by design
 Cold blooded vixen, she don't compromise

 Before you play with fire, do think twice
 And if you get burned, don't be surprised

       If I had to,
                             I would put myself right beside you
 So let me ask
            Would you like that?

        And I don't mind
                              If you say this love is the last time

 I was looking around at tabs for this song and I found one that worked really well, by a
 called ""thebigbadburn"" - so kudos to him.
 I have removed the B5 chord that he used  in the chorus' and replaced it with a G as I
 it works better. Also, I put the chord names
 above the words where they occur, mainly for the beginners who may not be able to work
 out etc etc (me being one of them haha).
 I pick most of this, as I have done it for acoustic guitar - and in places such as the
 of verse 1, where I have put Am twice, just
 shows where I put the emphasis on the chord.
  
 But as I said, very similar to the other tab - so no hate comments about stealing it or
 I just tidied it up a bit.

               I am 'bout to go

       I'll lie and you'll believe
         Just tonight I will see

         Just tonight I will stay
            And we'll throw it all away
           When the light hits your eyes
       It's telling me I'm right
         And if I, I am through
       It's all because of you
  
         Just tonight
       It's all because of you

 [Verse 1]
  
   hello, world
              hope you're listening
                    forgive me if I'm young
                     or speaking out of turn
  but there's someone that I've been missing
                             and I think that they could be
                    the better half of me
                 they're in the wrong place tryin' to make it right
        and I'm tired of justifying
    so I say to you...
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
        come home
       come home
                           cause I've been waiting for ya
         for so long
         for so long
                          and right now there's a war between the vanities
      but all I see is you and me
            and the fight for you is all I've ever known
           so come home
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
   I get lost in the beauty
                of everything I see
                          the world ain't half as bad
  
 as they paint it to be
   if all the sons
            all the daughters
                   stop to take it in
                     well hopefully the hate subsides and the love can begin
                 it might start now
      or maybe I'm just dreaming out loud
      but un- til then
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
       come home
       come home
                           cause I've been waiting for ya

         for so long
                          and right now there's a war between the vanities
      but all I see is you and me

              so come home
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 everything I can't be
     is everything you should be
       and that's why I need you here
 everything I can't be
      is everything you should be
        and that's why I need you here
                 so hear this now

 He must've forgot to close his door

 I can tell cause it's a bit darker

 I forgot about the drought
                         Of light bulbs in this house
 So I head out
                                  Down a route I think is heading south
 But I'm not good with directions
                       And I hide behind my mouth
   I'm a pro at imperfections
                               And I'm best friends with my doubt
 And now that my mind's out
                              And now I hear it clear and loud
 I'm thinking, 'Wow
 I probably should've stayed inside my house.'

              'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue

 [INTRO]
  
  
  
 [VERSE]
  
 Dreams, that's where I have to go
                   to see your beautiful face anymore
     I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
 Hope, hope there's a conversation
                               where we both admit we had it good but
 until then it's alienation, I know, that much is understood
 And I realize
  
  
 [CHORUS]
  
         If you ask me how I'm doin I would say I'm doin just fine
         I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
        But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
      and finally I'm forced to face the truth
            No matter what they say, I'm not over you
     Not over you
  
  
 [VERSE 2]
  
 Damn, damn girl you do it well
                           And I thought you were innocent
     You took this heart and put it through hell
                          But still you're magnificent
 I I'm a boomerang doesn't matter how you throw me
 Turn around and I'm back in the game
                           Even better than the old me
 ( But I'm not even close without you
  
  
 [CHORUS]
  
         If you ask me how I'm doin I would say I'm doin just fine
         I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

      and finally I'm forced to face the truth
            No matter what they say, I'm not over you
  
  
 [BRIDGE]
  
 And if I had the chance to renew
 You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
          I could get back on the right track
       But only if you'd be convinced
 So until then

 Ewan ko ba kung bakit sa libo-libong babaeng

         You're face-to-face with greatness and it's strange
                 You don't even know how you feel, It's adorable!
            Well it's nice to see that humans never change
  
            Open your eyes, let's begin
                  Yes it's really me, It's Maui! Breathe it in

          For the tides, the sun, the sky
             Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
      I'm just an ordinary demi-guy!
  
 [Verse 2]
                      Hey, what has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
                          When you were waddling ye high?
 This guy!
  
    When the nights got cold, who stole you fire from down below?
          You're looking at him, yo!
  
 Oh, also I lasso'd the sun
 You're welcome
      To stretch your days and bring you fun
  
          Also, I harnessed the breeze
 You're welcome
      To fill your sails and shake your trees
  
 [Chorus]
 What can I say except ""You're welcome""?
           For the islands I pulled from the sea
                     There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome
     I guess it's just my way of being me
          You're welcome, you're welcome
   Well, come to think of it

 Kid, honestly I can go on and on
  
 I can explain every natural phenomenon
  
 The tide, the grass, the ground
  
 Oh, that was Maui just messing around
  
 I killed an eel, I buried its guts
  
 Sprouted a tree, now you've got coconuts
  
 What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
  
 Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway
 And the tapestry here in my skin
 Is a map of the victories I win
 Look where I've been I make everything happen
 Look at that mean mini Maui just tippity tappin'
  
 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, Hey!

 Well anyway, let me say you're welcome!

         Well, come to think of it, I gotta go

               I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome!
         'Cause Maui can do anything but float

         When a man loves a woman,   can't keep his mind on nothing else
   He'll trade the world for the good thing he's found
           If she's bad he can't see it      she can do no wrong
 Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

         When a man loves a woman, spend his very last dime
 Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
           He'd give up all his comfort, sleep out in the rain
 If she said that's the way it ought to be

 Well, this man loves a woman

   Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
 Baby, please don't treat me bad

 (Track 04 - 'Grace' album)
 This is virtually the same as most other Lilac Wine tabs I've seen on the net, except I
 it to make it easier to play so you can focus more on the incredible vocals!  I made it
 by just putting a capo on the 3rd fret, which makes all the chords easier to play.
 you're going to miss some of the little complexities that Jeff Buckley adds to the
 but this is an OK version I hope will be of use to people!
 Please don't flame me, I know it's not the perfect version, that's the point!
  
 Capo - 3rd fret
  
 [Verse]
 I lost myself on a cool damp night
 Gave myself in that misty light
 Was hypnotized by a strange delight
 Under a lilac tree
 I made wine from the lilac tree
 Put my heart in its recipe
 It makes me see what I want to see...
 And be what I want to be
 When I think more than I want to think
 Do things I never should do
 I drink much more than I ought to drink
 Because it brings me back you...

 Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
 Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
 Listen to me... I cannot see clearly
 Isn't that she coming to me nearly here?

 Lilac wine is sweet and heady, where's my love?
 Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love
 Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
 Isnt that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?

 Michael, they have taken you away

        Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay

      Now you must raise our child with dignity

 Simplified interpretation - intended to be close enough to jam to, not exact! I offer,
 hopefully, all the breakdown and detail you need to get started on this classic. Add in
 complexity as desired with other tabs. I've migrated about 5 tabs into this version, and
 modified some of that to an easier set. Now, this has just become the way I play the song
 all the time, so I thought I'd share. (Oh, and below is the best breakdown of the intro).

 Chord Notes:
  
 The chords of contraversy are going to be the G barre and Gm. The closest tab shows a Eb7/G
 (365333) played for both of these. Though, that didn't sound right and was hard to play
 (maybe the later is why it sounded off to me). I think the Gm with the mellower Chorus 1
 (""where you going for tommorrow..."") strumming and mutes sounds pretty cool (even if not
 exact). Then switching to a regular G bar in the main Chorus (""when the dogs to find
 her..."") sounds just fine for rocking it out a bit more (changing things up, etc). Same
 thing with the regular F barre, sounds just fine to me, and matches up with my Gm and G
 barre nicely. If my chords are too simplified, tinker with them. But, I layout the song and
 break it down it with good enough detail that this version should be useful.

 [Verse 1]
       Hey, once upon a younger year
  
 When all our shadows disappeared
      The animals inside came out to play
            Hey, when face to face with all our fears
  
 Learned our lessons through the tears
       Made memories we knew would never fade
  
             One day my father he told me
              Son, don't let this slip away
      He took me in his arms, I heard him say
  
                  When you get older
                       Your wild heart will live for younger days
   Think of me if ever you're afraid
  
  
 [Chorus]

 [Verse 2]
       When thunder clouds start pouring down
  
 Light a fire they can't put out
 Carve your name into those shining stars
             He said go venture far beyond these shores
  
 Don't forsake this life of yours
       I'll guide you home no matter where you are
  
             One day my father he told me
              Son, don't let this slip away

       And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had sh-t!
 Give away a few Mercedes like here lady have this,
 And last but not least grant somebody their last wish.

 I'll be playing basketball with the President,
 Dunking on his delegates.
 Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette.
 Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it.
 But keep the fives, twentys, tens in bins completely separate.
 Yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket.
 We in recession but let me take a crack at it.
 I'll probably take whatevers left and just split it up.
 So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks.
 And, not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was.
 Eating good, sleeping soundly.
 I know we all have a similar dream.
 Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing..

 Alright, the other versions don't seem to be quite the way it was meant to be played (half step or
 full step up). So hope this helps, especially for those who love the Anthology acoustic version
 much better than the Abbey Road version. The big difference is that Abbey Road is played just like
 this, but Anthology plays it in the key of A, so if you choose to play it like that, you will
 have to use the transposer and set it to -3 (Three half steps down.) Otherwise, that's all. Hope
 y'all like my first tab! (Thank you to carriep63 for the edits (And for the second time as well,
 sounds much better.)) Now this is the Anthology version, so not everything will sound exactly like
 the recordings on Abbey Road. For me personally, I like playing an Em at the second line of the
 verse  instead of a C, but the C sounds much more correct, and I personally do C# at the end of
 the verse, but Eb sounds much better when the B string is brought out. Hope you enjoy!

   Jangan minta jatuh cinta
   Luka lama ku juga belum reda
   Beri dulu aku waktu untuk sembuh sendirinya
   Bukan ku tak jatuh cinta
   Lelah ulang kesalahan yang sama
   Ku ingin kita jalani cinta (ku ingin kita)
   Ku ingin kita jalani cinta
   Tanpa tergesa
   Tanpa tergesa

 [Verse]
    I should know who I am by now,
    I walk the record stand somehow,
    Thinkin' of winter
    Your name is the splinter inside me
         While I wait
  
 [Chorus]
    And I remember the sound
    Of your November downtown,
    And I remember the truth,
    A warm December with you,
        But I don't have to make this mistake,
        And I don't have to stay this way
                   If only I would wake...
  
 [Verse]
 The walk has all been cleared by now
 Your voice is all I hear somehow
 Calling out winter
 Your voice is the splinter inside me
         While I wait
  
 [Chorus]
    And I remember the sound
    Of your November downtown,
    And I remember the truth,
    A warm December with you,
        But I don't have to make this mistake,
        And I don't have to stay this way
                   If only I would wake...

    I could have lost myself
     In rough blue waters in your eyes,
     And I  miss you still

 Oh! I remember the sound
 Of your November downtown,
 And I remember the truth,
 A warm December with you,
        But I don't have to make this mistake,

 I thought love was only true in fairy tales
                              And (Meant) for someone else but not for me
 Love was out to get me

                      Stumbled 'round the block a thousand times
                    You missed every call that I had tried, so now I'm giving up
 A heartbreak in mid December
      You don't give a fuck, you never remember me
 While you're pulling on his jeans
                          Getting lost in the big city
                         I was looking out our window
                   Watching all the cars go, wondering if I'll see Chicago
                     Or a sunset on the West-Coast
                   Or will I die in the cold
                     Feeling blue and alone
               I wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 I hope you get your ballroom floor,
                                     Your perfect house with rose-red doors,
                             I'm the last thing you remember,
  
 I's been a long lonely December.
  
 I wish I'd known that less is more,
                               But I was passed out on the floor,
                                 And that's the last thing I remember,
  
 It's been a long lonely December.

 Cast me aside to show yourself in a better light,
                                                   I came out grieving, barely breathing and you came out alright.
           But I'm sure you'll take his hand,
               I hope he's better than I ever could've been,
     My mistakes were not intentions,
             This is a list of my confessions I couldn't say
  
 Pain is never permanent, but tonight it's killing me

                               But I was passed out on the floor,
                                 And that's the last thing I remember,
                          It's been a long lonely December.

 [Verse]
  
       Para kang asukal
      sintamis mong magmahal
        para kang pintura
        buhay koy ikaw ang nagpinta
     para kang unan
       pinapainit mo ang aking tiyan
      para kang kumot
          na yumayakap sa tuwing
             ako'y nalulungkot

        Kung hindi man tayo hanggang dulo
                  wag mong kalimutan
           nandito lang ako
              laging umaalalay
 di ako lalayo
               dahil ang tanging panalangin
  
 ko ay ikaw
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 [C G Am F]
 di baleng maghapon na umulan
 basta't ikaw ang sasandalan
 liwanag ng lumulubog na araw
 kay sarap pagmasdan
 lalo na kapag nasisinagan ang
 iyong mukha
 ayoko nang magsawa
 hinding hindi magsasawa sa'yo

 [Verse]
  
  Your day breaks, your mind aches
  You find that all the words of kindness linger on
              When she no longer needs you
  
  
 [Verse]
  
  She wakes up, she makes up
  She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
         She no longer needs you
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
             And in her eyes you see nothing
  No sign of love behind the tears
            Cried for no one
  A love that should have lasted years
  
  
 [Verse]
  
  You want her, you need her
  And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
      You think she needs you

  There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
 You won't forget her

  No sign of love behind the tears

 Chords I Used:
  
  
 [Chorus]
 I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
                The start of nothing
                     I had no chance to prepare
                     I couldn't see you coming
                The start of nothing, ooh
           I could hate you now
 It's quite alright to hate me now
 When we both know that deep down
                    The feeling still deep down is good
  
 [Verse 1]
 If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
 If you could see my thoughts you would see our faces
 Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
 We didn't give a fuck back then
             I ain't a kid no more
 We'll never be those kids again
                We drived to Syd's, had the X6 back then
            Back then
                   No matter what I did
                    My waves wouldn't dip back then
 Everything sucked back then
 We were friends
  
 [Chorus]
 I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
 The start of nothing
                      I had no chance to prepare
                     I couldn't see you coming
               The start of nothing, ooh
          I could hate you now
 It's quite alright to hate me now
 When we both know that deep down
                    The feeling still deep down is good
  
 [Verse 2]
 In the halls of your hotel
 Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
 How much I meant to you,  meant it sincere back then
                 We had time to kill back then
 You ain't a kid no more
                       We'll never be those kids again
                 It's not the same, ivory's illegal
 Don't you remember?
 I broke your heart last week
 You'll probably feel better by the weekend
            Still remember, had you going crazy
 Screaming my name
          The feeling deep down is good
  
 [Chorus]
 I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
 The start of nothing
                      I had no chance to prepare
                     I couldn't see you coming
               The start of nothing, ooh
          I could hate you now
 It's quite alright to hate me now
 When we both know that deep down
                    The feeling still deep down is good
  
 [Verse 3]
 All the things I didn't mean to say
           I didn't mean to do
 There were things you didn't need to say
      You didn't mean to... mean to
 I've been dreamin' of you
 Dreamin' of you
 I've been dreamin' of you
 Dreamin' of you
 I've been dreaming, dreamin'

                 Covering their old heartbreaks with new tattoos
                 It's all about smoke screens and cigarettes
                  Looking through low lights at silhouettes

 If you don't use the suggested chord shapes below then be sure to keep the line cliche of the
 progression of Gm Gbaug Bb/F Em7b5 similar as this is important to have mostly the same notes
 and just have a descending chromatic bass line in this part.
 Gm/F  xx3333 can be substituted for Bb/F, and E7b5  xx2330 (no3) can be substituted for Em7b5.

 [Verse 1]
  
       Some things in life are bad, they can really make you mad
        Other things just make you swear and curse
              When you're chewing on life's gristle
        Don't grumble, give a whistle
      And this'll help things turn out for the best
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
      And always look on the bright side of life
     Always look on the light side of life
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
     If life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten
       and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
              When you're feeling in the dumps, don't be silly chumps
       Just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing

              Come on, always look on the bright side of life
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
       For life is quite absurd and death's the final word
           You must always face the curtain with a bow
     Forget about your sin - give the audience a grin
     Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
      So always look on the bright side of death
 Just before you draw your terminal breath
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
 Life's a piece of shit   when you look at it
 Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
         You'll see it's all a show,
           keep 'em laughing as you go
         Just remember that the last laugh is on you
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
      And always look on the bright side of life
 Always look on the right side of life
 (Come on guys, cheer up)
 Always look on the bright side of life
 Always look on the right side of life ...

             He didn't even touch his food
                  How many torn photographs
  
 I saw you taping back, tell me that
     You couldn't see an open door... but no more
                                 If you let me inside of your world
  
 There's gonna be one less lonely girl
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Ohh oh oh
       Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you, you
                    Now all I see is you
  
 Noo no no
    don't need these other pretty faces, like i need you
 ‘cause when you're mine, in the world
                                     there's gonna be one less lonely girl
                    One less lonely girl

                              I'll show you what you're worth
                              If you let me inside your world

 Intro:   
  
 I met you in the dark
 You lit me up...
 You made me feel as though
 I was enough...
  
 We danced the night away
 We drank too much
 I held your hair back when
 You were throwing up
  
 Then you smiled over your shoulder
 For a minute, I was stone cold sober
 I pulled you closer to my chest
 and you asked me, to stay over
 I said, I already told ya
 I think that you should get some rest
  
 I knew I loved you then
 But you'd never know
 Cause I played it cool when I was
 Scared of letting go
 I know I needed you
 But I'll never show
 I wanna stay with you
 Until we're grey and old
 Say you won't let go
 Just say you won't let go 
  
 I'll wake you up with some
 breakfast in bed
 I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
  
 I'll take the kids to school
 wave them goodbye
 And I'll thank my lucky stars, for that night
 When you looked over your shoulder
 For a minute I forget that I'm older
 I wanna dance with you right now
  
 And you look as beautiful as ever
 And I swear that every day'll get better
 You make me feel this way somehow
  
 I'm so in love with you
 And I hope you know
 Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
  
 We've come so far my dear
 look how we've grown
 and I wanna stay with you till we're grey and old
 Just say you won't let go
 Just say you won't let go
  
 I wanna live with you
 even when we're ghosts 
 you were always there for me 
 when i needed (you) the most
  
 Cause I'm gonna love you till
 My lungs give out
 I promise till death we part
 Like in our vows
  
 So I wrote this song for you
 now everybody knows 
 that it's just you and me till we're grey and old
  
  
 Just say you won't let go
 Just say you won't let go
 Just say you won't let go
 Just say you won't let go

 [Verse 1]
  
 Dancing in the dark, middle of the night
 Taking your heart, and holding it tight
    Emotional touch, touching my skin
      And asking you to do what you been doing all over again
  
  
 [Pre-chorus]
  
                Ohhhh, it's a beautiful thing, don't think I can keep it all in
         I just got to let you know, what it is that won't let me go
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
            It's your love, it just does something to me
                         It sends a shock right through me, I can't get enough
             And if you wonder about the spell I'm under
     Oh, it's your love
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Better than I was, and more than I am
      And all of this happened, by taking your hand
      And who I am now, is who I wanted to be
      And now that were together I'm stronger than ever, I'm happy and free
  
  
 [Pre-chorus]
  
                Ohhhh, it's a beautiful thing, don't think I can keep it all in
            And if you ask me why I've changed all I got to do is say your sweet name
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
            It's your love, it just does something to me
                         It sends a shock right through me, I can't get enough

         Dylan
  
 [Verse]
  
 The guilty undertaker sighs,
      The lonesome organ grinder cries,
      The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
      The cracked bells and washed-out horns 
 Blow into my face with scorn,
           But it's not that way,
                   I wasn't born to lose you.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
    I want you, I want you,
    I want you so bad,
                Honey, I want you.
  
  
 [Verse]
  
      The drunken politician leaps
   Upon the street where mothers weep
          And the saviors who are fast asleep,
      They wait for you.
        And I wait for them to interrupt
 Me drinkin' from that broken cup
      And ask me to
              Open up the gate for you.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
    I want you, I want you,
    I want you so bad,
                Honey, I want you. 
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
      Now all my fathers, they've gone down,
 True love they've been without it.
      But all their daughters put me down
         'Cause I don't think about it.
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
      And talk with my chambermaid.
 She knows that I'm not afraid
     To look at her
 She is good to me
 And there's nothing she doesn't see.
      She knows where I'd like to be
 But it doesn't matter.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
    I want you, I want you,
    I want you so bad
           Honey, I want you.
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit,
     He spoke to me, I took his flute.
 No, I wasn't very cute to him, 
 Was I?
        But I did it, though, because he lied
 Because he took you for a ride
      And because tine was on his side
      And because I...

 [Verse 1]
        I've never seen you looking so lovely, as you did tonight.
        I've never seen you shine so bright... ooo... ooo
        I've never seen so many men asking if you wanted to dance.
            They're looking for a little romance, given half a chance.
              And I have never seen that dress you're wearing.
            Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes.
                 I have been blind.
  
 [Chorus]
              The lady in red,       is dancing with me.... Cheek to cheek.
                  There's nobody here,  it's just you and me.
                       It's where I want to be.
                But I hardly know    this beauty by my side.
              I'll never forget    The way you look tonight.

        I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side,
                And when you turned to me and smiled, it took my breath away,
              And I have never had such a feeling,
          Such a feeling of complete and utter love, as I do tonight,

 Poisoning themselves now, begging for our help, wow

 [Verse 1]
  
    Look at this Photograph, everytime I do it makes me laugh,
                                   How did our eyes get so red, and what the hell is on joeys head.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
    And this is where I grew up, I think the present owner fixed it up,
                                    I never knew we ever went without,the second floor is high for sneakin out
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 and this is where I went to school, most of the time had better things to do
                                     Criminal record says I broke in twice, I must have done half a dozen times
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
      I wander if it's too late, should I go back and try to graduate,
                                       Life's better now than it was back then, if I was them I would'nt let me in!
            Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
          Every memory of lookin out the back door, I had the photo album spread 
                                out on my bedroom floor, It's hard to say it, time to say it, Good-bye! 
  
 Good-bye!
  
          Every memory of walkin out the front door, I found the photo of the friend 
                               that I was looking for, It's hard to say it, time to say it, Good-Bye! Good-
  
 Bye!

  We used to listen to the radio, and sing along to every song we'd know,
                                             We said someday we'd find out how it feels, to sing to more than just the 
                 steering wheel.
  
  
 [Verse 6]
  
  Kim's the first girl I kissed, I was so nervous that I nearly missed,
                                         She's had a couple of kids since then, I haven't seen her since god knows  
     when!  Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!

          I miss that town, I can't beleive it, So hard to stay, so hard to

 Breaking down, breaking in
 Never knowing what lies ahead

 I've been searching my whole life to find my own place
            And maybe it's the party talking or the chocolate fondue
           But with you
             But with you

        I’m a phoenix in the water
    A fish that’s learnt to fly
           And i’ve always been a daughter
      But feathers are meant for the sky
         So I’m wishing, wishing further
          For the excitement to arrive
                It’s just I’d rather be causing the chaos
                     Than laying at the sharp end of this knife
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 (A bit sketchy)
  With every small disaster
  I’ll let the waters still
  Take me away to some place real
  
 [Chorus]
                   'Cause they say home is where your heart is set in stone
    where you go when you’re alone
    Is where you go to rest your bones
       It’s not just where you lay your head 
          It's not just where you make your bed
     As long as we’re together, does it matter where we go?
  Home
  Home
  
 [Verse]
        So when I’m ready to be bolder,
    And my cuts have healed with time
        Comfort will rest on my shoulder
           And I’ll bury my future behind
        I’ll always keep you with me
    You’ll be always on my mind
        But there’s a shining in the shadows
             I’ll never know unless I try
 With every small disaster
 I’ll let the waters still
 Take me away to some place real
  
 [Chorus]
                  'Cause they say home is where your heart is set in stone
    where you go when you’re alone
    Is where you go to rest your bones
       It’s not just where you lay your head 
          It's not just where you make your bed

 High dive into frozen waves
 where the past comes back to life
 Fight fear for the selfish pain
          And it's worth it every time
 Hold still right before we crash
           Cause we both know how this ends
 our clock ticks till it breaks your glass
        And I drown in you again

 I wish I didn't need
 Chasing relentlessly
 Still fight and I don't know why

 walk on through a red parade
 And refuse to make amends
 It cuts deep through our ground
 And makes us forget all common sense

 If you pull, then I'll push too deep
 And I'll fall right back to you

 [Verse]
  I am driving up eighty five in the 
  Kind of morning that  lasts all afternoon 
  I’m just stuck inside the gloom 
  
  Four more exits to my apartment but 
  I am tempted to keep the car in drive 
     And leave it all behind 
  
          ‘Cause I... wonder sometimes about the outcome
          Of a still verdictless life

       Am I living it right?

 [Verse]
 Rent a room and I fill the spaces with 
 Wood in places to make it feel like home 
    But all I feel’s alone 
  
 It might be a quarter life crisis 
    Or just the stirring in my soul 
  
  
              Either way  I... wonder sometimes about the outcome
          Of a still verdictless life

 Don’t believe me
         When I say      I’ve    got     it down 
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  Everybody is just a stranger, but
  that’s the danger in going my own way 
     I guess it’s the price I have to pay

    reason    not to    ask myself if I am

 (amazing) and I think I got a better grasp on how it is supposed to be played.
  
 With Aadd9, her guitar player Luis tends to put his pinky on the G string on and off
 (I previously posted that he did the same thing on the high E string, but I was wrong).
 Listen to the song and you should get what I am talking about (ie. does it
 during ""Hypocrites you're all here for the very same REASON"")
 Similarly, it can also be done while playing E in places like ""hands"" during the
 chorus. (B7sus4)  Just play with the pinky on the G string again.

   I thought he was a bitter man   He spoke of women's ways

   For love is blind and you're far too kind   Don't ever let it show

      Well I was sittin', waitin', wishing 
 You believed in superstitions 
 Then maybe you'd see the signs 
      The Lord knows that this world is cruel 
        and I ain't the Lord, no I'm just a fool 
           Learning lovin' somebody don't make them love you

         Must I always be playing, playing your fool

         I can't always be waiting, waiting on you 
         I can't always be playing, playing your fool

   I keep playing your part but it's not my scene 
                    Want this plot to twist I've had enough mystery 
                        You keep building it up then shootin' me down 
                   But I'm already down just wait a minute 
   Just sittin', waitin' 
   Just wait a minute
   Just sittin', waitin'
  
  
 [Verse 3]
        Well, if I was in your position 
      I'd put down all my ammunition 
      I'd wonder why'd it taken me so long 
      But Lord knows that I'm not you 
      And if I was, I wouldn't be so cruel 
        Cause waitin' on love ain't so easy to do

 [Verse 1]
          To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
          Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
          No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
                                             for the stranger there amongst them had a big iron on his hip
   Big iron on his hip
  
  
 [Verse 2]
          It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
           He came ridin' from the south side slowly lookin' all around
           He's an outlaw loose and runnin' came the whisper from each lip
                                              And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
   big iron on his hip
  
  
 [Verse 3]
           In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
        Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
          He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four
                                          And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
   One and nineteen more
  
  
 [Verse 4]
           Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
          Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
           He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
                                        And he said it didn't matter, he was after Texas Red
   After Texas Red
  
  
 [Verse 5]
           Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
           But the outlaw didn't worry, men that tried before were dead
          Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip
                                           Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
   Big iron on his hip
  
  
 [Verse 6]
       The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
          It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
              Folks were watching from their windows, everybody held their breath
                                      They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
   About to meet his death
  
  
 [Verse 7]
             There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
           And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
         Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
                                            And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
   Big iron on his hip
  
  
 [Verse 8]
          It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
         There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
          Oh, he might have gone on living but he made one fatal slip
                                              When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
   Big iron on his hip

 Chords:
  
                 
 Okay the main ostinato pedal you can hear on this piece is actually played on
 a harpsichord but there is a way on the guitar that you can emulate that sound.
  
 Hold this chord (use your thumb for the first note)
  
 e|0|                                    e|-----0---------0------0-----------|

 It's played repeatedly throughout the whole song with the exception of some
 instrumental breaks with drum fils.

     Tell me your troubles and doubts, giving me everything inside and out, and out.

     Going to take you apart, I'll put us back together at heart, baby.

    I hurt myself today
     To see if I still feel
    I focus on the pain
      The only thing that's real
      The needle tears a hole
      The old familiar sting
         Try to kill it all away
        But I remember everything

 What have I become
 My sweetest friend
 Everyone I know goes away
         In the end
      And you could have it all
 My empire of dirt
 I will let you down
 I will make you hurt

    I wear this crown of thorns
 Upon my liar's chair
 Full of broken thoughts
 I cannot repair
 Beneath the stains of time
      The feelings disappear
 You are someone else
 I am still right here

 I will make you hurt
     If I could start again
    A million miles away
 I would keep myself
 I would find a way

 So your friends been telling me
                               You've been sleeping with my sweater
               And that you can't stop missing me
 Bet my friends been telling you

 Only half a blue sky
 Kinda there but not quite
 I'm walking round with just one shoe
 I'm a half a heart without you
 I'm half the man, at best
 With half an arrow in my chest
                       I miss everything we do
 I'm a half a heart without you

 Forget all we said that night
                     No it doesn't even matter

 If you could spare an hour or so
                                     We'll go for the lunch down by the river
           We could really talk it through

 Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods?
 Where’s the street-wise Hercules to fight the rising odds?
 Isn’t there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
    Late at night I toss and turn and I dream of what I need.

       He’s gotta be strong and he’s gotta be fast,
           And he’s gotta be fresh from the fight.
           I need a hero, I’m holding out for a hero ‘til the morning light,
       He’s gotta be sure, and it’s gotta be soon,
           And he’s gotta be larger than life...

 knowing that I won't

 [Opening Chorus]
            Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road,
            Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones.
         Smoke rollin' out the window,
                     An' ice cold beer sittin' in the console.
          Memory lane up in the headlights,
                   It's got me reminiscing on them good times.
       I'm turning off of real life, drivin' that's right,
               I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires.
  
  
 [Verse 1]
 Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go.
  
 Load the truck up, hit the dirt road.
 Jump the barbwire, spread the word.
  
 Light the bonfire, then call the girls.
 The king in the can and the Marlboro man.
  
 Jack and gin were a few good men.
 Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too.
  
 Better watch out for the boys in blue.
 And all this small town he said, she said,
  
 Ain't it funny how rumors spread.
 Like I know something ya'll don't know,
  
 Man that talk is gettin' old.
 Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth,
  
 Before I have to knock that loud mouth out.
 I'm tired of talkin, man, ya'll ain't listenin',
  
 Them old dirt roads is what ya'll missin'.

 [Verse 2]
 I sit back and think about them good ole days.
  
 The way we were raised, and our southern ways,
 And we like cornbread, and biscuits,
  
 And if it's broke round here we fix it.
 I can take ya'll where ya need to go,
  
 Down to my hood, back in them woods.
 We do it different 'round here, that's right,
  
 But we sure do it good, and we do it all night.
 See, if you really wanna know how it feels,
  
 To get off the road with trucks and four wheels,
 Jump on in, and man, tell your friends,
  
 We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends.
  
  
 [Chorus]
        I'm chillin' on a dirt road.

0,Land Locked Blues chords,Land Locked Blues – Bright Eyes,"    If you walk away, I'll walk away
        First tell me which road you will take
    I don't want to risk our paths crossing some day
         So you walk that way, I'll walk this way
  
           And the future hangs over our heads
         And it moves with each current event
           Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain
            Just stay in when it's looking this way
  
          And the moon's laying low in the sky
          Forcing everything metal to shine
          And the sidewalk holds diamonds like the jewelry store case
             They argue walk this way, no, walk this way
  
      And Laura's asleep in my bed
          As I'm leaving she wakes up and says
                      ""I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
       Baby don't go away, come here""
  
              And there's kids playing guns in the street
           And ones pointing his tree branch at me
       So I put my hands up I say ""enough is enough,
         If you walk away, I'll walk away""
                     And he shot me dead
  
  I found a liquid cure
  For my landlocked blues
        It'll pass away like a slow parade
       It's leaving but I don't know how soon
  
          And the world's got me dizzy again
                  You think after 22 years I'd be used to the spin
         And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
                So I'm always pacing around or walking away
  
         I keep drinking the ink from my pen
          And I'm balancing history books up on my head
         But it all boils down to one quotable phrase
         If you love something, give it away
  
         A good woman will pick you apart
         A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
          But you may be offended and you may be afraid
            But don't walk away, don't walk away
  
          We made love on the living room floor
           With the noise in the background from a televised war
              And in the deafening pleasure I thought I heard someone say
        ""If we walk away, they'll walk away""
  
      But greed is a bottomless pit
          And our freedom's a joke we're just taking a piss
          And the whole world must watch the sad comic display
            If you're still free start running away
  
 Cause we're coming for you!
  
             I've grown tired of holding this pose
         I feel more like a stranger each time I come home
         So I'm making a deal with the devils of fame
                Saying ""let me walk away, please""
  
            You'll be free child once you have died
           From the shackles of language and measurable time
           And then we can trade places, play musical graves
            Till then walk away, walk away
  
 So I'm up at dawn
 Putting on my shoes
          I just want to make a clean escape

 Tu safar mera

 Ae dil hai mushkil
  
 Tu mera Khuda
 Tu hi duaa mein shaamil
 Tere bina guzara
 Ae dil hai mushkil

    Jitna hua tera
  
    Tune diya hai jo
     Woh dard hi sahi
      Tujhse mila hai toh
    Inaam hai mera
  
 Mera aasmaan dhoondhe teri zameen

 Shiddat se chaahun
 Chaahe toh rehna tu be-khabar
 Mohtaaz manzil
 Ka toh nahi hai
 Ye ek tarfa mera safar
  
 Safar Khoobsurat hai manzil se bhi
 Meri har kami ko hai tu laazmi

 Adhura hoke bhi
 Hai ishq mera kaamil

  So many things that I want to say, you know I like my girls a little bit

 [Verse 1]
   So no one told you life was gonna be this way
 Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A
 It's like you're always stuck in second gear
          When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year
  
 [Chorus]
        (But)   I'll be there for you (when the rain starts to pour)
          I'll be there for you (like I've been there before)
          I'll be there for you ('cause you're there for me too)
  
 [Verse 2]
  You're still in bed at ten & work began at 8
  You've burned your breakfast, so far things are going great
   Your mother warned you there'd be days like these
          But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees
  
 [Chorus]
         (Then)   I'll be there for you (when the rain starts to pour)

 No one could ever know me
 No one could ever see me
 Seems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me
 Someone to face the day with
 Make it through all the mess with
 Someone I'll always laugh with
 Even under the worst I'm best with you

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 No I'm not color blind 
                                     I know the world is black and white
 Try to keep an open mind but...
                                    I just can't sleep on this tonight
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Stop this train I want to get off and go home again
                              I can't take the speed it's moving in, I know I can't
      But honest   -   ly won't someone stop this train
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Don't know how else to say it, don't want to see my parents go
 One generation's length away
                                   From fighting life out on my own
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""Gmmaj7"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Gmmaj7</span> Stop this train I want to get off and go home again
                              I can't take the speed it's moving in, I know I can't
      But honest   -   ly won't someone stop this train
  
  
 [Interlude]
  
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 So scared of getting older
                         I'm only good at being young
 So I play the numbers game to find away to say that life has just begun
 Had a talk with my old man
 Said help me understand
 He said turn 68, you'll renegotiate
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
        Don't stop this train
                                Don't for a minute change the place you're in
                              Don't think I couldn't ever understand, I tried my hand
        John, honest   -   ly we'll never stop this train
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
      See once in a while when it's good
        It'll feel like it should
              And they're all still around
             And you're still safe and sound
          And you don't miss a thing
           'til you cry when you're driving a - way in the dark.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
          Singing stop this train I want to get off and go home again
                               I can't take this speed it's moving in, I know I can't
        Cause now      I see I'll never stop this train

 [Verse 1]
  
      The last that ever she saw him
 Carried away by a moonlight shadow
     He passed on worried and warning
 Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
 Lost in a riddle that Saturday night
 Far away on the other side.
         He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
          And she couldn't find how to push through
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
      The trees that whisper in the evening
 Carried away by a moonlight shadow
         Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
 Carried away by a moonlight shadow
 All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
 Far away on the other side.
         He was shot six times by a man on the run
          And she couldn't find how to push through

   I stay I pray
      See you in heaven far away
   I stay I pray
      See you in heaven one day
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 Four am in the morning
 Carried away by a moonlight shadow
    I watched your vision forming
 Carried away by a moonlight shadow
 Star was light in a silvery night
 Far away on the other side
           Will you come to talk to me this night
          But she couldn't find how to push through

 Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
 The night was heavy and the air was alive
          But she couldn't find how to push through

 Words by Roger Waters

 [Verse]
  
     Breathe, breathe in the air.
         Don't be afraid to care.
         Leave but don't leave me.
 Look around and choose your own ground.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
      For long you live and high you fly
      And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
 All you touch and all you see
     Is all your life will ever be.
  
  
 [Verse]
  
     Run, rabbit run.
 Dig that hole, forget the sun,
     When at last the work is done
 Don't sit down it's time to dig another one.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
      For long you live and high you fly
      But only if you ride the tide
      And balanced on the biggest wave

 [With clocks, alarms, and bells for approximately 40 seconds]
  
  
 N.C.(E)  (F#m)  (E)  (F#m)  (E)  (F#m)  (E)  (F#m)  (A)  (E)  (F#m)
  
  
 Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
 Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
                                              Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
 Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.
  
  
 Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.
 You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.
 And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.
 No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.
  
  
 [Guitar solo]
  
  
  
  
             And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
 Racing around to come up behind you again.
                                                      The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,
 Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.
  
  
 Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.
 Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
 Hanging on in quiet desparation is the English way
      The time is gone, the song is over,
 Thought I'd something more to say.
  
  
  
 Breathe (Reprise)
 -----------------
 Words by Roger Waters
 Music by Roger Waters, David Gilmour & Rick Wright
  
  
  
     Home, home again.
     I like to be here when I can.
     When I come home cold and tired
     It's good to warm my bones beside the fire.
 Far away across the field
 The tolling of the iron bell
 Calls the faithful to their knees
     To hear the softly spoken magic spell.
  
  
  
  
 The Great Gig In The Sky

 Money
 -----
 Words and Music by Roger Waters
  
  
 Money, get away.
 Get a good job with more pay and you're okay.
 Money, it's a gas.
 Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.
  
 New car, caviar, four star daydream,
  
 Think I'll buy me a football team.
  
  
 Money, get back.
 I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack.
 Money, it's a hit.
 Don't give me that do goody good bullshit.
  
             I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
  
                           And I think I need a Lear jet.
  
  
 Money, it's a crime.
 Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie.
 Money, so they say
 Is the root of all evil today.
  
 But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're
  
               giving none away.

 Us And Them
 -----------
 Words by Roger Waters
 Music by Roger Waters & Rick Wright
  
  
  
  
  
 Us, and them
                          G/D            D  (A/D)  (D)  A/D
 And after all we're only ordinary men.
 Me, and you.
                               God only knows it's not what we would choose to do.
 Forward he cried from the rear
                and the front rank died.
      The general sat and the lines on the map
 moved from side to side.
  
 Black and blue
                                   And who knows which is which and who is who.
         Up and down.
                           And in the end it's only round and round and round.
   ""Haven't you heard? It's a battle of words""
 the poster bearer cried.
   ""Listen son"", said the man with the gun
   ""There's room for you inside.""
  
  
  
  
  
 Down and out
                                   It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about.
 With, without.
                                 And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
 Out of the way, it's a busy day
 I've got things on my mind.
          For the want of the price of tea and a slice
 The old man died.

 Brain Damage
 ------------
 Words and Music by Roger Waters
  
 [Verse]
  
   The lunatic is on the grass
   The lunatic is on the grass
   Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
 Got to keep the loonies on the path
  
 [Verse]
  
   The lunatic is in the hall
   The lunatics are in my hall
   The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
      And every day the paper boy brings more
  
 [Bridge 1]
  
   And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
      And if there is no room upon the hill
   And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
       I'll see you on the dark side of the moon
  
 [Verse]
  
   The lunatic is in my head.    (laughter)
   The lunatic is in my head
   You raise the blade, you make the change
   You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane.
  
   You lock the door and throw away the key
          There's someone in my head but it's not me.
  
 [Bridge 2]
  
   And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
   You shout and no one seems to hear
   And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
       I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

 Eclipse

 Words and Music by Roger Waters
  
  
 All that you touch, and all that you see
 All that you taste,         all you feel
  
      And all that you love, and all that you hate
 All you distrust,           all you save
  
      And all that you give, and all that you deal
      And all that you buy,     beg, borrow or steal
  
      And all you create, and all you destroy
      And all that you do,     and all that you say
  
      And all that you eat, and everyone you meet
      And all that you slight and everyone you fight
  
      And all that is now, and all that is gone
 All that's to come,     and everything under
      The sun is in tune, but the sun is eclipsed by the moon

 [Verse 1]
  
 Tell me, tell me that you want me
                       And I'll be yours completely, for better or for worse
 I know, we'll have our disagreements
                     Be fighting for no reason, I wouldn't change it for the world
        Cause I knew, the first day that I met you
                    I was never gonna let you, let you slip away
      And I still remember feeling nervous
                     Trying to find the words to get you here today
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
    You make my heart feel like it's summer
    When the rain is pouring down
    You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
                     That's how I know that you are the one
    That's why I know you are the one
  
 Oooooooh ooooooooh
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 In life, it's easy to be scared of
                   With you I am prepared for what has yet to come
 Cause our two hearts will make it easy
                 Joining up the pieces, together making one
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
    You make my heart feel like it's summer
    When the rain is pouring down
    You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong

    That's why I know you are the one
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 When we are together you make me feel like my mind is free
          And my dreams are reachable (oh-oh-oh-oh)
 You know I never ever believed in love or believed one day
          That you would come along (oh-oh-oh-oh)
      And free me
  
  
 [Chorus]

 [Verse]
  
 I've been down so low people look at me and they know
            They can tell something is wrong
       Like I don't belong
 Well, staring through a window standing outside there just to happy to care tonight
 I wanna be like them but I'll mess it up again
 I tripped on my way in, got kicked outside, everybody saw
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And I know that it's a wonderful world
                      But I cant feel it right now
            Well, I thought I was doing well but I just want to cry now
          Well I know that its a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea
             But I can only see it when you're here, here with me
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Sometimes I feel so full of love it just comes spilling out
       It's uncomfortable to see I give it away so easily
 But if I had someone I would do anything I'd never never never never let you feel alone
     I wont, I wont leave you on your own
 Who am I to dream, dreams are for fools, they let you down

             But I can only see it when you're here, here with me
  
  
 [Bridge]     
 And I wish that I could make it better
             I'd give anything for you to call me
 Maybe just a little letter
               Oh it could start again
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And I know that it's a wonderful world
                      But I cant feel it right now
            Well, I thought I was doing well but I just want to cry now
          Well I know that its a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea
             But I can only see it when you're here, here with me
  
          And I know that its a wonderful world
                  I cant feel it right now
         I got all the right clothes to wear I just wanna cry now
     I know that it's a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea
             But I can only see it when you're here, here with me
         And I know that it's a wonderful world
                    When you're with me

 [Verse 1]
  
 Where are those happy days - they seem so hard to find.
 I try to reach for you but you have closed your mind.
 Whatever happened to our love?
 I wish I understood.
 It used to be so nice, it used to be so good.

 [Chorus]
  
 So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me, SOS
 The love you gave me, nothing less can save me, SOS
 When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
 When you're gone, though I try how can I carry on?
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 You seem so far away though you are standing near.
 You make me feel alive but something died, I fear.
 I really tried to make it up - I wish I understood.
 What happened to our love, it used to be so good.
  
  
 [Interlude]

 So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me, SOS

 I know you think that I shouldn't still love you

 Well, I'd still have felt it

 [VERSE I]
  
       It's always been about me myself and I
     If all relationships were nothing but a waste of time
    I never wanted to be anybody's other half
     I was happy saying I'd a love that wouldn't last
 That was the only way I knew 'til I met you
       You make we wanna say
  
  
 [CHORUS]
  
    I do, I do, I do do do do do do do doo
          Yeah, I do, I do, I do do do do do do do doo
         'Cause every time before we spend like maybe yes and maybe no
    I can live without it,   I can let it go
 Ooh, I did, I get myself into
     You make we wanna say I do, I do, I do, I do, I do,      I do
  
  
 [VERSE II]
  
 Tell me is it only me, do you feel the same
    You know me well enough to know that I'm not playing games
   I promise I won't turn around and I won't let you down
    You can trust I've never felt it like I feel it now
 Baby there's nothing, there's nothing we can't get through
       So can we say
  
  
 [CHORUS]
  
    I do, I do I do do do do do do do doo
             Oh baby, I do, I do, I do do do do do do do doo
         'Cause every time before we spend like maybe yes and maybe no
    I will live without it,   I will let it go
 What more can I get myself into?
     You make we wanna say
  
  
 [BRIDGE]
  
 Me a family, a house, a family
     Ooh, can we be a family?
    And when I'm eighty years old I'm sitting next to you
    And will remember when we said
  
  
 [CHORUS]
  
     I do, I do, I do do do do do do do doo
              Oh baby, I do, I do, I do do do do do do do doo
         'Cause every time before we spend like maybe yes and maybe no
    No I won't live without it,   I won't let us go
 Just look at what we got ourselves into
     You make we wanna say I do, I do, I do, I do, I do,      I do
        Love you.

 [Verse]
  
                     Ich ging wie ein Ägypter hab' mit Tauben geweint
                War ein Voodookind wie ein rollender Stein.
           Im Dornenwald sang Maria für mich.
                      Ich starb in deinen Armen, Bochum 'Vierund-achtzig`
                Ich ließ die Sonne nie untergeh`n
                     ...in meiner wundervollen Welt.
  
  
 [Refrain]
  
                      Und ich singe diese Lieder,tanz' mit Tränen in den Augen
                           Bowie war für'n Tag mein Held und EMF kann es nich' glauben
                        Und ich steh' im lila Regen, ich will ein Feuerstarter sein
                          Whitney wird mich immer lieben und Michael lässt mich nich` allein.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
                        Ich war willkommen im Dschungel und fremd im eigenen Land.
                    Mein persönlicher Jesus und im Gehirn total krank.
                      Und ich frage mich, wann werd' ich, werd' ich berühmt sein.
                   So wie Rio, mein König für die Ewigkeit.
                      Ich war am Ende der Straße angelangt,
                     war ein Verlierer, Baby, doch dann hielt ich ein Cover in der Hand-
             darauf ein Mönch, der in Flammen stand
          Kurt Cobain sagte mir, ich soll kommen wie ich bin...
  
  
 [Refrain]
  
                      Und ich singe diese Lieder tanz' mit Tränen in den Augen,
                           Bowie war für'n Tag mein Held und EMF kann es nich' glauben.
                        Und ich steh' im lila Regen ich will ein Feuerstarter sein,
                          Whitney wird mich immer lieben und Michael lässt mich nich' allein
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
                         Ich war einer von fünf Jungs ""One Minute"" aus, dann war's vorbei.
                        Ich sang nur noch für mich, für 'ne unendlich lange Zeit.
                    Dann traf ich auf sie und sie erinnerte mich.
                      Wir waren Welten entfernt und doch vom selben Stern.
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
    Huuh, Huuh, Huuuh Huuuh, Huuh, Huuuuuh, Huuuuuh

      Ich ging wie ein Ägypter hab' mit Tauben geweint.
                          War ein Voodookind wie ein rollender Stein.
                         Ich ließ die Sonne nie untergehen...
  
   ...in meiner wundervollen Welt

                           Und jetzt sing ich meine Lieder tanz' mit Tränen in den Augen,
                           Bowie war für'n Tag mein Held und EMF kann es nich' glauben.
                        Und ich steh' im lila Regen ich will ein Feuerstarter sein,
                          Whitney wird mich immer lieben und Michael lässt uns nich' allein
  
                        Denn wir singen diese Lieder tanzen mit Tränen in den Augen,
                          Bowie war für'n Tag ein Held und EMF kann es nich' glauben.

 [Verse 1:]
 Well she was precious like a flower
             She grew wild, wild but innocent
 A perfect prayer in a desperate hour
           She was everything beautiful and different
          Stupid boy... you can't fence that in
          Stupid boy... it's like holdin' back the wind
  
 [Chorus:]
         She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
           And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
             She never even knew she had a choice
       And that's what happens when the only voice
                She hears is telling her she can't

 So what makes you think you could take a life
             And just push it, push it around
 I guess to build yourself up so high
              You had to take her and break her down
 Well.....

         She laid her heart and soul right in your hands

 City's breaking down on a Camel's back.
 They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack
 So all you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
 You won't get out the county, 'cos you're damned and free
  
 You've got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style.
 A melancholy town where we never smile.
 And all I wanna hear is the message beep.
 My dreams, they've got to kiss, because I don't get sleep, no..

 Turn forever hand in hand
 Take it all there on your stride
 It is sinking, falling down

 Is everybody in?

0,Break Free chords,Break Free – Ariana Grande,"The song premiered an hour ago, sorry if the lyrics are not correct.
 This is the easiest way I found to play it... if you want to make it better get rid of the capo!
 There were D s n the bridge, between notes, but it's too hard to get them right
 so I deleted them, sounds ok anyway.
 Listen closely to the instrumental parts so you get the notes right.
  
 UPDATE: VendelaHyde was right and I changed the Bm s to B7 s, you can still play Bm
 Both chords are hard for beginners but there are easier and more ways to cheat a Bm than a B7
  
 Cheat the B7 like this (from easiest to dificult):

 [Verse 1]
  
 I can't count the times
 I almost said what's on my mind
 But I didn't
 Just the other day
              I wrote down all the things I'd say
 But I couldn't
  
 I just couldn't
    Baby I know that you've been wondering
    Mmm, so here goes nothing

                  And I would be lying if I said
               That I could live this life without you
         Even though

       You had my heart a long long time ago
 In case you didn't know
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 The way you look tonight
 That second glass of wine
 That did it
 There was something bout that kiss
 Girl it did me in
 Got me thinking

     All of the things that I've been feeling
    Mmm it's time you hear 'em

   I've been down and I'm wondering why
        These little black clouds keep walking around
       With me, with me
   It wastes time and I'd rather be high
            Think I'll walk me outside and buy a rainbow smile but be free
              They're all free

                 Did you ever think,
                       That we could be so close, like brothers?
  The future's in the air,

    Naging matigas ang iyong ulo
     At ang payo nila'y sinuway mo

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
 God of creation
 There at the start, before the beginning of time
       With no point of reference
      You spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of light
  
 [Chorus]
               And as You speak
                    A hundred billion galaxies are born
                        In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
           If the stars were made to worship, so will I
                          I can see Your heart in everything You've made
                          Every burning star, a signal fire of grace
        If creation sings Your praises, so will I
  
 [Verse 2]
 God of Your promise
      You don't speak in vain, no syllable empty or void
      For once You have spoken
      All nature and science, follow the sound of Your voice
  
 [Chorus 2]
               And as You speak
                      A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
                 Evolving in pursuit of what You said
         If it all reveals Your nature, so will I
                          I can see Your heart in everything You say
                       Every painted sky, a canvas of Your grace
        If creation still obeys You, so will I
            (So will I,    so will I)
  
 [Bridge]
           If the stars were made to worship, so will I
            If the mountains bow in reverence, so will I
          If the oceans roar Your greatness, so will I
          For if everything exists to lift You high, so will I
             And if the wind goes where You send it, so will I
         If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I
         If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
             Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times

               And as You speak
                    A hundred billion failures disappear
                              Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
          If You left the grave behind You, so will I

                           Every part designed in a work of art called love
         If You gladly chose surrender, so will I

 [Verse]
      You walked into the party;
               like you were walking on to a yacht
       Your hat, strategically dipped below one eye;
       your scarf it was apricot
          You had one eye in the mirror as   you watched yourself gavotte
              And all the girls dreamed that they’d be your partner, they'd be your partner and

 You're so vain,

 You're so vain,
 I’ll bet you think this song is about you, don't you, don't you
  
 [Verse]
      You had me several years ago;
        when I was still quite naive
             Well, you said that we make such a pretty pair 
       and that you would never leave
           But you gave away the things you loved and one of them was me
             I had some dreams; they were clouds in my coffee, clouds in my coffee and

          Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga and your horse naturally won
           Then you flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia
             To see the total eclipse of the sun
              Well you're where you should be all the time
      and when you're not you're with

 [Verse 1]
   I can see you standing, honey
   With his arms around your body
   Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
   And it took you five whole minutes
   To pack us up and leave me with it
   Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

   I can see you starin', honey
   Like he's just your understudy
   Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
   Second, third, and hundredth chances
   Balancin' on breaking branches
   Those eyes add insult to injury

 He is jealous for me
 Love's like a hurricane, I am a tree
 Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy
  
  
 When all of a sudden, I am unaware of these
 Afflictions eclipsed by glory
        And I realize just how beautiful You are
          And how great your affections are for me.

 We are His portion and He is our prize,
 Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes
 If grace is an ocean we're all sinking ha ha
  
  
     So heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss

 Mommy took a bus trip and now she got her bust out
  
 Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
 Hail Mary to the city your a Virgin
  
 And Jesus can’t save you life starts when the church ends
 Came here for school, graduated to the high life

 MDMA got you feeling like a champion

 Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's

 Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons whipping pastry
                Cruising down 8th street, off white Lexus
  
 Driving so slow but BK is from Texas
               Me I’m up at Bedsty, home of that boy Biggie
  
 Now i live on billboard, and i brought my boys with me
                 Say what up to Ty Ty, still sipping Malta
  
 Sitting court-side Knicks and Nets give me high fives

 Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
 Hail Mary to the city your a Virgin
  
 And Jesus can’t save you life starts when the church ends

  I walk a lonely road
      The only one that I have ever known
             Don't know where it goes
 But it's home to me and I walk alone

 On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams

 Of the edge and where I walk alone

   Read between the lines
 What's fucked up and everything's alright

 Are you still afraid?
 Just close your eyes and dream

 (ELIZA)
  
    I saved every letter you wrote me
   From the moment I read them
    I knew you were mine
                     You said you were mine
                     I thought you were mine

 “Be careful with that one, love
          He will do what it takes to survive.”

 You and your words flooded my senses
        Your sentences left me defenseless
 You built me palaces out of paragraphs
               You built cathedrals
           I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me
        I’m searching and scanning for answers
      In every line
                    For some kind of sign

             This girl into our bed
                   In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
  
 Do you know what Angelica said
                            When she read what you’d done?
           She said

          He has flown too close to the sun.”

 You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...
         Your sentences border on senseless
 And you are paranoid in every paragraph
              How they perceive you
  
 You, you, you…
  
  
       I’m erasing myself from the narrative
       Let future historians wonder how Eliza
 Reacted when you broke her heart
 You have torn it all apart
  
 I am watching it

                    The world has no place in our bed
        They don’t get to know what I said
       I’m burning the memories
               Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
        You forfeit all rights to my heart
                   You forfeit the place in our bed
          You'll sleep in your office instead
        With only the memories
               Of when you were mine

                        ripping out the pages
                          How'd i get so faded?
 Oh no no don't leave me lonely now
          If you love me how do you never learn
 Oh colour crimson in my eyes
                             One or two could free my mind      now
  
 [Chorus]
 This is how it ends
 I feel the chemicals
 burning my bloodstream
 Fading out again
 I feel the chemicals 
 burning my bloodstream
  
 So tell me when it kicks in
  
 [Interlude]
  
 Well tell me when it kicks in
  
  
 [Verse]
 I've been looking for a love
                                   Thought I'd find her in a bottle
                          God make me another one
  
 I'll be feeling this tomorrow
  
 Lord forgive me for the things I've done
                                I was never meant to hurt no one
                         I saw scars upon her broken heart
  
 Oh no no don't leave me lonely now
          If you love me how do you never learn
 Oh colour crimson in my eyes
                             One or two could free my mind      now

                              Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
             Hey that's me and I want you only
                              Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
  
        Don't run back inside, darling you know just what I'm here for

              You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright
         Oh and that's alright with me
  
          You can hide neath your covers and study your pain
       Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
 Waste your summer praying in vain
        For a saviour to rise from these streets
               Well now I'm no hero, that's understood
          All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
         With a chance to make it good somehow
      Hey what else can we do now?
  
         Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
  
 Well the night's busting open
        These two lanes will take us anywhere
                                    We got one last chance to make it real
     To trade in these wings on some wheels
                Climb in back heaven's waiting down on the tracks
  
 Oh oh come take my hand
        We re riding out tonight to case the promised land
 Oh oh oh oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road,
 Lying out there like a killer in the sun
      Hey I know it's late we can make it if we run
 Oh oh oh oh Thunder Road, sit tight take hold, Thunder Road
  
 Well I  got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
         And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
            From your front porch to my front seat
             The door's open but the ride it ain't free
      And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
        But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken
             There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
  
 They haunt this dusty beach road
         In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
                                        They scream your name at night in the street
                  Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet and in the
 Lonely cool before dawn you hear their engines roaring on but when you
 Get to the porch they're gone on the wind so Mary climb in

          You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain,
       Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain.
 Waste your summer praying in vain for a savior to rise from these streets.
       Well now I'm no hero that's understood;
          All the redemption I can offer girl is beneath this dirty hood.
 With a chance to make it good somehow, hey what else can we do now, except;
 Roll down the window and let the wind blow back our hair.
                                     Well the night's busted open these two lanes can take us anywhere.
                                    We got one last chance to make it real;
     to trade in these wings on some wheels,
                          Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks.
  
 Ohh come take my hand; we're ridin out tonight to case the Promised Land.
 Oh Thunder Road, Oh Thunder road, Oh Thunder Road.
  
 Lyin' out there like a killer in the sun;
 Hey I know it's late, we can make it if we run.
 Oh Thunder Road, sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road.
  
       So I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk.
         And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk.
            From your front porch to my front seat, 
         Door's open but the ride ain't free.
       Well I know you've been waiting for words that I ain't spoken,
       Well tonight we'll be free; all the promises will be broken.
  
             There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away.
                                           They drive this dusty beach road, in the skeleton frames of 
 burned-out Chevrolets.
                   They scream your name at night in the street,
                  Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet.
             And in the lonely cool before dawn; you hear their engines roaring on;
            Until you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind: so Mary climb in,
         It's a town full of losers and we're pulling out of here to win.

 It seems much easier to transpose down a half step than trying to play Eb Cm7 Ab Bb7 that 
 the other tab uses. I made some adjustments to those chords. You can use these chord forms
 get a nice increase in pitch through the four chords.

      That gets a nice bass line in the 4th string (0,4,5,7) -- don't know if that's a
 reason for dropping the 7ths (F#7 & A7) used in the other version and the Wendy Colonna
 that follows. I've only done a few tabs so comments are welcome.  --Arthur Marks

 A different acoustic take. She hits top note twice and then strums once for each chord
 the 6th string on the G, the 5th on the E7 and C, and the 4th on the D7). The timing with
 singing is very tricky for me. --Arthur Marks

    And hey darling
    I hope you're good tonight
        And I know you don't feel right when I'm leaving
 Yeah I want it but no I don't need it
 Tell me something sweet to get me by
       'Cuz I can't come back home till they're singing
  
  
 [Bridge]

         Then I swear come tomorrow

 Repeat the last part as many times as necessary.
 Plenty of practice, enjoy! :].
 I apologize for all of the corrections I had to make during the approval process, I was
 distracted when I was writing it originally, and missed some notes, and forgot a chord
 two. It's correct now. :].

 [Verse]
  
 All day staring at the ceiling
         Making friends with shadows on my wall
 All night hearing voices telling me
       That I should get some sleep
 Because tomorrow might be good for something
  
 Hold on
 Feeling like I'm headed for a breakdown
 And I don't know why
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
             I know right now you can't tell
 But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
  
 A different side of me
 I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
               I know right now you don't care
 But soon enough you're gonna think of me
                    And how I used to be...me
  
  
 [Verse]
  
      I'm talking to myself in public
 Dodging glances on the train
 And I know, I know they've all been talking about me
 I can hear them whisper
         And it makes me think there must be something wrong with me
 Out of all the hours thinking
 Somehow I've lost my mind
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
             I know right now you can't tell
 But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see
  
 A different side of me
 I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired

         Sa tanghali, sa gabi at umaga
           Huwag ka sanang magtanong at magduda
            Dahil ang puso ko'y walang pangamba

 [Verse]
            come home early after class
           don't be hanging round the back of the schoolyard
              I've been called up by a teacher
               she says she can't even reach you cause you're so far
               you've been talking with your fist
            we didn't raise you up like this, now did we
                    there have been changes in this house
          things you don't know about in this family
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
                it don't make sense, but nevertheless
                    you gotta believe us, it's all for the best
                it don't make sense
                 the way things go

 [Chorus]
            sometimes moms and dads fall out of love
            sometimes two homes are better than one
                  some things you can't tell your sister 'cause she's still too young
              yeah you'll understand
                     when you love someone.
  
 [Verse]
              There ain't no one here to blame
 nothing's going to change with your old friends
       Your room will stay the same
                'cause you'll only be away on the weekends
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
                it don't make sense, but nevertheless
                    you gotta believe us, it's all for the best
                it don't make sense
               It don't add up
                 We'll always love you no matter what

 [Chorus]
 My tea's gone cold, I'm wonderin' why
      Got out of bed at all
              The morning rain clouds up my window
      And I can't see at all
           And even if I could it'll all be gray
           But your picture on my wall
          It reminds me that it's not so bad
       It's not so bad
 My tea's gone cold, I'm wonderin' why
      Got out of bed at all
              The morning rain clouds up my window
      And I can't see at all
           And even if I could it'll all be gray
           But your picture on my wall
          It reminds me that it's not so bad
       It's not so bad
  
 [Verse 1]
 Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin
                                   I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
                                 I sent two letters back in Autumn, you must not have got 'em
                                        There probably was a problem with the post office or somethin'
 Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
                          But anyway, what's been up man, how's your daughter?
                                              My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
              If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her
                        I'm a name her Bonnie
                          I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
   I had a friend kill himself over some b**** who didn't want him
                                         I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
                         I even got that underground s*** that you did with Skam
                            I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
                                I like that s*** you did with Rawkus too, that s*** was phat
                      Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back
 Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

       It's not so bad
  
 [Verse 2]
       Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance,
 I ain't mad, I think it's just f***** up that you don't answer fans
                              If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
             You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
           That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
                   We waited in the blistering cold for you
      For four hours and you just said no
                                   That's pretty s****y man, you're like his f***ing idol
     He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
                          I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
        Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I write you
            You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
                  I never knew my father neither
             He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
                              I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
            So when I have a s****y day, I drift away and put em on
                Cause I don't really got s*** else, so that s*** helps when I'm depressed
 I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
 Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
           Its like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
          See everthing you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
         My girlfriend's jealous, because I talk about you 24/7
 But she don't know you like I know you slim, no one does
 She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
            You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
            Sincerely yours, Stan, p.s.
 We should be together too

           And even if I could it'll all be gray

       It's not so bad
  
 [Verse 3]
 Dear Mr I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans
                                This'll be the last package I ever send your a**
                It's been six months and still no words
             I don't deserve it
                    I know you got my last two letters
                 I wrote the addresses on them perfect
 So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
      I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
 Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
                             You know that song by Phil Collins, In the Air of the Night
 About that guy who could've saved that other guy from drowning
      But didn't, but Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him
 That's kinda how this is, you could've rescued me from drowning
           Now it's too late, I'm on a 1,000 downers now, I'm drowsy
 And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
 I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off my wall
 I love you Slim, we could've been together, think about it
                      You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
                                 And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
 I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
               See Slim, shut up b****, I'm trying to talk
 Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
 But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
 Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more, then she'll die too
                 Well, gotta go, I'm almost under the bridge now
                    Oh s***, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this s*** out?

      And I can't see at all
           And even if I could it'll all be gray
           But your picture on my wall
          It reminds me that it's not so bad
       It's not so bad
  
 [Verse 4]
 Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I've just been busy
 You say your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
 Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
                And here's an autograph for your brother
    I wrote it on this Starter cap
                     I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
 Don't think I did that s*** intentionally just to dis you
                               But what's that s*** you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
                                    I say that s*** just clownin' dog
                               C'mon, how f***ed up is you?
                               You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling 
 To keep your a** from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
                                And what's this s*** about us meant to be together?
 That type of s*** will make me not want us to meet each other
                              I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
 Or maybe you just need to treat her better
 I hope you get to read this letter, I hope it reaches you in time                
             Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine
           If you relax a little, I'm glad that I inspire you, but Stan
      Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
                           I just don't want you to do some crazy s***
              I seen this one s*** on the news a couple of weeks ago that made me sick
                                    Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
              And had his girlfriend in his trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
             And in the car they found a tape, didn't say who it was to
          Come to think about it, his name was, it was you...

 [Intro]
  
 My song is love
 Love to the loveless shown
 And it goes on
             You don't have to be alone
  
  
 Your heavy heart
 Is made of stone
 And it's so hard to see clearly
            You don't have to be on your own
             You don't have to be on your own
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And I'm not gonna take it back
 And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
 You're the target that I'm aiming at
            And I'll get that message home
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 My song is love
 My song is love, unknown
 But I'm on fire for you, clearly

 And I'm not gonna take it back
 And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that

         That I love you, please come home

 makes it easier to switch to the G's

 I play Em/G like this so I can go nicely between that and the G chord and it
 sounds a bit like it does on the piano

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 I’ve learned to slam on the brake
 Before I even turn the key
 Before I make the mistake
 Before I lead with the worst of me
 Give them no reason to stare
 No slipping up if you slip away
 So I got nothing to share
 No I’ve got nothing to say
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 Step out, step out of the sun
         If you keep getting burned
 Step out, step out of the sun
    Because you’ve learned
    Because you’ve learned
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 On the outside
 Always looking in
         Will I ever be more than I’ve always been?
            Cause I’m tap, tap, tapping on the glass
      I’m waving through a window
 I try to speak but nobody can hear
 So I wait around for an answer to appear
            While I’m watch, watch, watching people pass
      I’m waving through a window
              Can anybody see?
                            Is anybody waving back at me?
  
  
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 We start with stars in our eyes
 We start believing that we belong
 But every sun doesn’t rise
 And nobody tells you where you went wrong
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 Step out, step out of the sun
         If you keep getting burned
 Step out, step out of the sun
    Because you’ve learned
    Because you’ve learned
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 On the outside

         do you ever really crash or even make a sound?

 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""G#m7"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">G#m7</span>     You’re the kind of girl who can take down a man
      And lift him back up again
          You are strong, but you’re needy, humble but you’re greedy
      And based on your body language and shouted cursive I’ve been reading
       Your style is quite selective, but your mind is rather reckless
          Well, I guess it just suggests that this is just what happiness is.
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
   Hey, what a beautiful mess this is.
   It’s like picking up trash in dresses
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
          Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
 Kind of turn themselves into knives
           And don't mind my nerve you can call it fiction
          ‘Cause I like being submerged in your contradictions dear
         ‘Cause here we are, here we are
  
  
 [Interlude]
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
      Although you were biased I love your advice
       Your comebacks they’re quick and probably have to do with your insecurities
              There’s no shame in being crazy, depending on how you take these
 Words that paraphrasing this relationship we’re staging
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
   And it’s a beautiful mess, yes it is
   It’s like, we are picking up trash in dresses
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
          Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say
 Kind of turn themselves into blades
          And the kind and courteous is a life I’ve heard
           But it’s nice to say that we played in the dirt
       Cause here, here we are, Here we are
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Here we are, here we are, here we are, here we are
 Here we are, here we are, here we are, we’re still here

 [Chorus]
  
              And through timeless words in priceless pictures
        We’ll fly like birds not of this earth
      And tides they turn and hearts disfigure
            But that’s no concern when we’re wounded together
         And we tore our dresses and stained our shirts
           But it’s nice today, oh the wait was so worth it

 Waiting to finally be caught

 Keep you apart, deep in my heart
 Separate from the rest, where I like you the best

 [Verse 1]
 Menunggu sesuatu yang sangat menyebalkan bagiku 
                                  saat ku harus bersabar dan trus bersabar
                           menantikan kehadiran dirimu
                               entah sampai kapan aku harus menunggu

                                kadang kuberpikir cari penggantimu

    I guess it's funnier from where you're standing
   'Cause from over here I've missed the joke
    Cleared the way for my crash landing

 And the money was just rolling in

 Song: Over You
 Album: Daughtry
 Tabbed by: David
 Tuning: down 1/2 step
  
 I couldn't quite get the bridge and solo chords.
 The bridge has something sliding to an E and
 ends on Cm and D.  So if someone else can figure
 that out, it would be appreciated.  The rest
 should be good though
  
  
 [Verse]
 Now that it's all said and done,
 I can't believe you were the one
              To build me up and tear me down,
  
 Like an old abandoned house.
 What you said when you left
 Just left me cold and out of breath.
 I fell too far, was in way too deep.
                          Guess I let you get the best of me.
  
  
 [CHORUS]
 Well, I never saw it coming.
 I should've started running
 A long, long time ago.
 And I never thought I'd doubt you,
 I'm better off without you
 More than you, more than you know.
 I'm slowly getting closure.
 I guess it's really over.
 I'm finally getting better.
 And now I'm picking up the pieces.
 I'm spending all of these years
 Putting my heart back together.
 'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through,
         I got over you.
  
  
 [Verse]
 You took a hammer to these walls,
                                Dragged the memories down the hall,
              Packed your bags and walked away.
  
 There was nothing I could say.
 And when you slammed the front door shut,
                         A lot of others opened up,
            So did my eyes so I could see
                          That you never were the best for me.

 No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
 So deep in the swill with the most familiar of swine
        For reasons wretched and divine

 Laughing her way through my feeble disguise

     My child arrived just the other day
     He came to the world in the usual way
                                     But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
     He learned to walk while I was away
             And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
                He'd say ""I'm gonna be like you dad
      You know I'm gonna be like you""
  
          And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
 Little boy blue and the man on the moon
 When you comin' home dad?
    I don't know when, but we'll get together then 
      You know we'll have a good time then
  
  
     My son turned ten just the other day
            He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
                                      Can you teach me to throw"", I said ""Not today
    I got a lot to do"", he said, ""That's ok""
         And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
                 And said, ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah
      You know I'm gonna be like him""
  
          And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
 Little boy blue and the man on the moon

    I don't know when, but we'll get together then 
      You know we'll have a good time then
  
  
           Well, he came home from college just the other day
 So much like a man I just had to say
                                  ""Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?""
     He shook his head and said with a smile
            ""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
 See you later, can I have them please?""
  
          And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
 Little boy blue and the man on the moon
 When you comin' home son?
    I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad 
      You know we'll have a good time then
  
  
       I've long since retired, my son's moved away
    I called him up just the other day
                                  I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind""
                He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time
             You see my new job's a hassle and kids have the flu
           But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
            It's been sure nice talking to you""
  
      And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
       He'd grown up just like me
     My boy was just like me
  
          And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
 Little boy blue and the man on the moon
 When you comin' home son?
    I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad 
      You know we'll have a good time then

 [Verse 1]
     God rest ye merry gentlemen,
      Let nothing you dismay
    Remember Christ our savior
      Was born upon this day
     To save us all from Satan's power
       When we were gone astray
     Oh tidings of comfort and joy,
              Comfort and joy,
     Oh tidings of comfort and joy.
  
 [Verse 2]
       From God our heavenly father
       This blessed angel came
      And unto certain shepherds
          Brought tidings of the same
      How that in Bethlehem was born
      The son of God by name
    O tidings of comfort and joy,
              Comfort and joy
    O tidings of comfort and joy
  
 [Chorus]
 O, Star of wonder, star of night,
 Star with royal beauty bright
 Westward leading, still proceeding,
 Guide us to thy perfect light.

 Born a king on Bethlehem's plain,
 Gold I bring to crown him again
          King forever, ceasing never,
 Over us all to reign.

                  Star with royal beauty bright
 Westward leading, still proceeding,
 Guide us to thy perfect light.

 Glorious now, behold Him arise.
 King and God and sacrifice
       Hallelujah, Hallelujah!
 Worship him God most high

                     Out of nothing at all (making love)
   Out of nothing at all
  
  
   Every time I see you all the rays of the sun
       Are streaming through the waves in your hair
             And every star in the sky
             Is taking aim at your eyes like a spotlight
       The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
            And it's looking for a rhythm like you
                    You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
                    And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright
  
 I gotta follow it
         Cause everything I own, now
        It`s nothing till I give it to you
  
  
 [Solo]
  
  
        I can make the run or stumble,
        I can make the final block;
            And I can make every tackle, at the sound of the whistle,
        I can make all the stadiums rock
    I can make tonight forever
           Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
      And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
         And I can make all your demons be gone
          But I'm never gonna make it without you
         Do you really wanna see me crawl
          And I'm never gonna make it like you do
  
  
         Making love out of nothing at all
                                   (Making love) Out of nothing at all

 Oh, the more things change
 The more they stay the same

 Well my heart knows me better than I know myself
 N.C.
 So I'm gonna let it do all the talking.
 N.C.
 I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
  
 With a big black horse and a cherry tree.
 N.C.
 I felt a little fear upon my back
  
 He said ""Don't look back, just keep on walking.

 When the big black horse said, ""Look this way""
  
 Said, ""Hey, lady, will you marry me?""

 N.C. (muted brisk strumming throughout singing)
 And my heart hit a problem, in the early hours,
 So I stopped it dead for a beat or two.
  
 N.C.
 But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done it,
 And it won't forgive me after all these years
  
 N.C.
 So I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere
 With a big black horse and a cherry tree.
  
 N.C.
 Now it won't come back, 'cause it's oh so happy
 And now I've got a hole for the world to see

 In the verses, play the 5th string with your thumb, the 3rd string with your index, and
 the 2nd string with your middle finger.
 In the verses, you can also play this A chord:577655 and this Bm:799777.
 In the chorus, strum all the strings in the ritme of the song.

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
    Beauty queen of only eighteen
    She had some trouble with herself
    He was always there to help her
    She always belonged to someone else
    I drove for miles and miles
    And wound up at your door
    I've had you so many times but
    somehow I want more
  
 [Chorus]
    I don't mind spending everyday
    Out on your corner in the pouring rain
    Look for the girl with the broken smile
    Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
    And she will be loved
    She will be loved
  
 [Verse 2]
    Tap on my window knock on my door
    I want to make you feel beautiful
    I know I tend to get so insecure
    It doesn't matter anymore
    It's not always rainbows and butterflies
    It's compromise that moves us along
    My heart is full and my door's always open
    You can come anytime you want
  
 [Chorus]
    I don't mind spending everyday
    Out on your corner in the pouring rain
    Look for the girl with the broken smile
    Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
    And she will be loved
    She will be loved
  
 [Bridge]
    I know where you hide
                      Alone in your car
                         Know all of the things that make you who you are
    I know that goodbye means nothing at all
    Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls
    Tap on my window knock on my door
 Bm                         A (one strum and let ring)
    I want to make you feel beautiful
  
 [Chorus]
    I don't mind spending everyday
    Out on your corner in the pouring rain
    Look for the girl with the broken smile
    Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
    And she will be loved
    She will be loved
    And she will be loved
    She will be loved
    And she will be loved

 [Verse 1]
  
 She seemed dressed in all of me
                       Stretched across my shame
                           All the torment and the pain
                               Leaked through and covered me
                                    I'd do anything to have her to myself
                         Just to have her for myself
                            Now I don't know what to do
                       I don't know what to do
                     When she makes me sad
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 She is everything to me
                  The unrequited dream
                         The song that no one sings
                   The unattainable
                                         She's a myth that I have to believe in
                                          All I need to make it real is one more reason
                       I don't know what to do
                       I don't know what to do when she makes me sad
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
         But I won't let this build up inside of me
      I won't let this build up inside of me
      I won't let this build up inside of me
      I won't let this build up inside of me

 [Bridge]
  
     A catch in my throat, choke
 Torn into pieces, I won't. No.
     I don't want to be this but
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
         But I won't let this build up inside of me
      I won't let this build up inside of me
      I won't let this build up inside of me
      I won't let this build up inside of me
  
 Won’t let this build up inside of me

 Bitten by a dog with a rabid tooth
 She went to her grave just a little too soon
 Flew and lay down on the yellow moon

 [Verse 1]
  
         We may still have time, we might still get by
        Every time I think about it I want to cry
       With bombs and the devil, and the kids keep coming
    Nowhere to breathe easy, no time to be young
        But I tell myself that I'm doing alright
          There's nothing left to do tonight
  
  
 [Chorus] (or play riff)
  
          But go crazy on you
 Crazy on you
            Let me go crazy, crazy on you - ohh
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
     My love is the evening breeze touching your skin
      The gentle sweet singing of leaves in the wind
      The whisper that calls after you in the night
      And kisses your ear in the early light
      And you don't need to wonder, you're doing fine
 My love, the pleasure's mine

                 You know I'm a dreamer
         But my heart's of gold
           I had to run away high
       So I wouldn't come home low
            Just when things went right
                          It doesn't mean they're always wrong
                 Just take this song and you'll never
       Feel left all alone
                  Take me to your heart
                  Feel me in your bones
                Just one more night,

 Long and winding road

      The silver screen
                     My heart's like an open book
                For the whole world to read
            Sometimes nothing, keeps me together
 At the seams

          But you always knew that you'd be the one
     to work while they all play.
     In youth, you'd lay, 
   awake at night and scheme
     of all the things that you would change, 
      but it was just a dream.
  
 [Chorus]
 Here we are, don't turn away now,
 we are the warriors that built this town.
  
 Here we are, don't turn away now,
 we are the warriors that built this town 
       From dust
  
 [Verse 2]
                The time will come, 
              when you'll have to rise
   above the best, and prove yourself,
       your spirit never dies!
     Farewell, I've gone,
     to take my throne above, 
            but don't weep for me, 'cuz this will be 
      the labor of my love
  
 [Chorus]
 Here we are, don't turn away now,
 we are the warriors that built this town.
  
 Here we are, don't turn away now,
 we are the warriors that built this town

        And a young un's dream of growin' up to ride
       On a freight train leavin' town, not knowin' where I'm bound
         And no one could change my mind, but Mama tried
  
 [Verse 2]
          One and only rebel child, from a family meek and mild
      My Mama seemed to know what lay in store
            'Spite of all my Sunday learnin', toward the bad I kept on turnin'
       'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore

 Slow down you crazy child
            You're so ambitious for a juvenile
              But then if you're so smart tell me why
                     You are still so afraid
  
 Where's the fire, what's the hurry about
             You better cool it off before you burn it out
          You got so much to do and only
 So many hours in a day

               That you can get what you want
             Or you can just get old

 Slow down you're doing fine
               You can't be everything you want to be
 Before your time
                Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight,   tonight
  
   Too bad but it's the life you lead
             You're so ahead of yourself
              That you forgot what you need
                Though you can see when you're wrong
               You know you can't always see when you're right, you're right

 You got your passion you got your pride
        But don't you know that only fools are satisfied
  
 Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true   Ooo

                      I'm looking at you through the glass
                      Don't know how much time has passed
              Oh, God it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that
 Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
             How do you feel, that is the question
         But I forget, you don't expect an easy answer
         When something like a soul becomes initialized and folded up
             Like paper dolls and little notes, you can't expect a bit of hope
                   So while you're outside looking in, describing what you see
    Remember what you're staring at is me
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                      Don't know how much time has passed
              All I know is it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that
 Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
  
  
 Verse 2:(Repeat same chords)
  
             How much is real? So much to question
         An epidemic of the mannequins, contaminating everything
         And if that came from the heart it never did, right from the start
             Just listen to the noises (No more silent voices)
                  Before You tell yourself, It's just a different scene
   Remember it's just different from what you've seen
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                      Don't know how much time has passed

 A lot of the time I wrote just Bm D G when actually its played as written below.
 (I did this because when i wrote it in, it just cluttered up the tab and put off the timing)
 You play the Bm as normal but before going to the D you strike the top 4 strings
 open once. You then move to the D hammering on the 3rd fret on the high e a couple
 times. Just listen to the song goddamnit!

 [Verse 1]
  
 An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
 Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
 When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
 A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
 Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
 A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
 For he saw the Riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Yippie yi Ohhhhh
 Yippie yi yaaaaay
 Ghost Riders in the sky
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
 He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
 'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
 On horses snorting fire
          As they ride on hear their cry
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
 As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
 If you want to save your soul from Hell a-riding on our range
 Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
 Trying to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies

      I'm goin' to Carolina in my mind.
  
         With a holy host of others standing round me
 Still I'm on the dark side of the moon.
         And it seems like it goes on like this forever.

 if I'm up and gone to Carolina in my mind.

        So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl
         And I lost my heart to a Galway girl

 [Verse]
  
 Am I better off dead
 Am I better off a quitter
 They say I'm better off now
 Than I ever was with her
 As they take me to my local down the street
              I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet
 They say a few drinks will help me to forget her
 But after one too many I know that I'm never
 Only they can see where this is gonna end
               But they all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense
  
  
 [Chorus]
 And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
 'Cause I'm shouting your name all over town
 I'm swearing if I go there now
 I can change your mind, turn it all around
 And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
 And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
 Dial her number and confess to her
 I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing
  
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 So I stumble there, along the railings and the fences
 I know if I'm face to face that she'll come to her senses
 Every drunk step I take leads me to her door
 If she sees how much I'm hurting
         She'll take me back for sure
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
 'Cause I'm shouting your name all over town
 I'm swearing if I go there now
 I can change your mind, turn it all around
 And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
 And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
 Dial her number and confess to her
 I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing
  
  
 She said nothing
 Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
           Oh I got nothing
  
 Nothing
  
 I got nothing
  
 Nothing
  
 Oh I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
  
 Oh sometimes love is intoxicating
  
  
 Oh you're coming down your hands are shaking
  
  
 When you realise there's no one waiting
  
  
  
 Am I better off dead
 Am I better off a quitter
 They say I'm better off now
 Than I ever was with her

   Under the exit lights as beautiful as ever
   I really wish that I dressed up a little better
 No regrets is what we said, we can't go back again, darling

   Wish you the best, I would if I was able
 Morning light, it stings a little

 Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for, darling

 [Verse 1]
   Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,
      The little Lord Jesus, lay down his sweet head.
      The stars in the bright sky, looked down where he lay
      The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
      The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes;
      But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes.
    I love thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky,
      And stay by my bedside, till morning is nigh.
  
  
 [Verse 3]
     Be near me Lord Jesus, I ask thee to stay,
        Close by me forever, and love me I pray.
        Bless all the dear children, in thy tender care,
      And fit us for heaven, to live with thee there.

 [Verse 1]
               Well, it's a big big city and it's always the same
            Can never be too pretty, tell me your name
     Is it out of line if I was to be bold and say ""Would you be mine""?
  
            Because I may be a beggar and you may be the queen
               And though I may be on a downer I'm still ready to dream
         Though it's 3 o'clock, the time is just the time it takes for you to talk
  
 [Chorus]
               So if you're lonely, why'd you say you're not lonely
                  Oh, you're a silly girl, I know I heard it so
       It's just like you to come and go
    And know me, no you don't even know me
                  You're so sweet to try, oh my, you caught my eye
    A girl like you's just irresistible

 [Verse 2]
               Well, it's a big big city and the lights are all out
              But it's as much as I can do you know to figure you out
      And I must confess, my heart's all broken pieces
         And my head's a mess
           And it's 4 in the morning, and I'm walking along
             Beside the ghost of every drinker here who has ever done wrong
      And it's you, woo hoo
                                    That's got me going crazy for the things you do
  
 [Chorus]
               So if you're crazy I don't care, you amaze me
                  But you're a stupid girl, oh me, oh my, you talk
    I die, you smile, you laugh, I cry
 And only, a girl like you could be lonely
                And it's a crying shame, if you would think the same
    A boy like me's just irresistible

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
    I tried to be perfect
                  But nothing was worth it
            I don’t believe it makes me real
                    I thought it'd be easy
                But no one believes me
          I meant all the things I said
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                            If you believe it’s in my soul
          I’d say all the words that I know
                          Just to see if it would show
           That I’m trying to let you know
                            That I’m better off on my own
  
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
    This place is so empty
                     My thoughts are so tempting
               I don’t know how it got so bad
                    Sometimes it’s so crazy
                   That nothing can save me
               But it’s the only thing that I have
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                            If you believe it’s in my soul
          I’d say all the words that I know
                          Just to see if it would show
           That I’m trying to let you know

 [Bridge]
  
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
    I tried to be perfect
                 It just wasn’t worth it
                Nothing could ever be so wrong
                  It’s hard to believe me
                It never gets easy
            I guess I knew that all along

 [Verse]
  
 Baby, I know the story
                  I've seen the picture
          Its written all over your face
 Tell me, whats the secret
               That you been hiding
         And whose gonna take my place
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
      I should have seen it coming
      I should have read the signs
 Anyway...(Anyway) I-guess-its-o-ver
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
     Can't believe that I'm the fool again
      I thought this love would never end
      How was I to know - you never told me
      Can't believe that I'm the fool again
          And I thought you were my friend
       And how was I to know - you never told me....
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Baby, you should have called me,
                  When you were lonely
          When you needed me to be there
 Sadly,you never gave me,
               Too many chances
         To show you how much I care

        Empty spaces - what are we living for

 on and on, does anybody know what we are looking for?

 hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore?

              I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now,

 outside the dawn is breaking

 I need a photo-opportunity,
 I want a shot at redemption,

 wholl be my role-model,

 he is a foreign man,

 the sound, the sound,
         cattle in the marketplace,
 scatterlings and orphanages,
 he looks around, around,
         he sees angels in the architecture,
 spinning in infinity,
         he says Amen and Hallelujah!

 [Verse]
  
  Dry lightning cracks across the skies
  Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
  Her Daddy was a mean old mister
  Momma was an angel in the ground
  The weatherman called for a twister
  She prayed blow it down
  
            There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
        To wash the sins out of that house
            There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
        To rip the nails out of the past
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
     Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
            Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
                  'Til there's nothing left standing
     Nothing left of yesterday
           Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
            Blown away
  
  
 [Verse]
  
  She heard those sirens screaming out
  Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
  She locked herself in the cellar
  Listened to the screaming of the wind
  Some people call it taking shelter
  She called it sweet revenge
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
     Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
            Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away

 In the warm hold of your loving mind

 And everywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find.

 My first tab, hope you like......
  
 Standard Tuning: EADGBE
  
 Chords:
      EADGBE
      ------
 B    x2444x  Play with barred 3rd finger it's easiest
 A    x0222x  Jack plays with a barre and doesn't play high E
 E    0221xx  Sounds more like record if you don't play 1st and 2nd strings
 F#   2443xx  Likewise
  
  
 [Intro]
  
  *(Watch out when playing the D. If you listen to the record the pitch drops earlier
 than the previous chords, but it'll sound fine if you play D 5 times then let go.)

  *(The intro is played once, then on the second time through Jack starts singing
 on the second/third strike of the B Chord. Exactly the same rhythm.)
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 Fell in love with a girl 
 I fell in love once and almost completely 
 She's in love with the world
 But sometimes these feelings
 Can be so misleading 
  
 *(After the E has finished the B  is replaced by F#, same rhythm etc. just that change.

 She turns and says are you alright?
 I said I must be fine cause my heart's still beating
 Come and kiss me by the riverside, yeah
 F# *(Single strike of the chord then let it fade to end of line....)
 Bobby says it's fine he don't consider it cheating now
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Red hair with a curl 
 Mellow roll for the flavor and the eyes for peeping
 Can't keep away from the girl 
 These two sides of my brain need to have a meeting 
 *(I've got a friend says he's heard Jack sing it: I see stars in my brain, need a
 hallowed meeting, but the record sings it: These two sides....)
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Can't think of anything to do, yeah
 My left brain knows that all love is fleeting 
 She's just looking for something new, yeah
 F# *(again single strike and fade..........)
 I said it once before but it bears repeating now
 *(Where he sings 'all love is' it might be 'our love', make up your own minds)

 you'll have to listen to the record to get that right, I can't tab ahhhs.)

 To get a White stripes sound use an electric with humbuckers if possible
 (Jack plays an old airline) bridge pickup, gain arond 7 to 7.5, treble 7,
 mid 5.5 and bass 8. This is one of my fave songs and is soooo easy to play,
 I think this tab's pretty good so please rate it or post a comment it took me ages.

 [Intro]

 [Verse 1]
  
 I ponder of something great
     My lungs will fill and then deflate
       They fill with fire
  
 Exhale desire
     I know it's dire
  
 My time today
  
  
 [Hook]
  
 I have these thoughts
              So often I ought
  
 To replace that slot
   With what I once bought
  
 'Cause somebody stole
            My car radio
                                  And now I just sit in silence
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Sometimes quiet is violent
 I find it hard to hide it
      My pride is no longer inside
        It's on my sleeve
  
 My skin will scream
      Reminding me of
           Who I killed inside my dream
                        I hate this car that I'm driving
                         There's no hiding for me
                                    I'm forced to deal with what I feel
                           There is no distraction to mask what is real
 I could pull the steering wheel

 [Break]
  
 |  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 I ponder of something terrifying
 'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
 I find over the course of our human existence
 One thing consists of consistence
 And it's that we're all battling fear
       Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
 Oh my, too deep
  
 Please stop thinking
 I liked it better when my car had sound
  
 There are things we can do
                 But from the things that work there are only two
       And from the two that we choose to do
 Peace will win
  
 And fear will lose
           There's faith and there's sleep
      We need to pick one please because
 Faith is to be awake
              And to be awake is for us to think
                  And for us to think is to be alive
              And I will try with every rhyme
       To come across like I am dying
               To let you know you need to try to think

   She is the sweetest thing that I know
   Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
                            Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
   Took my heart upon a one way trip
                     Guess she went wandering off with it
                              And unlike most women I know

   And tin wind chimes used for doorbells

 [Verse 1]
  
 Do you feel like a chain store?
 Practically floored
 One of many zeros
 Kicked around bored
 Your ears are full, but you're empty
 Holding out your heart
 To people who never really
 Care how you are
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
             So give me Coffee & TV

 I've seen so much
      I'm going blind
          And I'm braindead virtually
       'Cos Sociability
       It's hard enough for me
 Take me away from this big bad world
  
 And agree to marry me
                  So we can start over again
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Do you go to the country?
     It isn't very far
 Those people there will hurt you
 'Cos of who you are
 Your ears are full of the language
          There's wisdom there you're sure
 'Til the words start slurring
 And you can't find the door

  Later we'll have some pumpkin pie, and we'll do some caroling.

  Voices singing; ""let's be jolly; deck the halls with boughs of holly"".

  Ev'ryone dancing merrily, in the new old-fashioned way.

 I want to go back, forget that it's over
 Painted in black, when you left me alone
 I never knew, she was sleeping next door

 Anymore, no more

 I dream I can hold you, and I can't go back to you anymore, yeah, yeah

                       Never really knowing why
 I wish I could be the perfect daughter

   Like to believe you are thinking of me
   And when the sun comes through your window
   I like to believe you've been dreaming of me
   Dreaming, mmmmm
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   I know cause i've spent half this morning
   Thinking about the tee shirt you sleep in
   I should know cause i'd spend,
          Oh the whole day
   Listening to your message i'm keeping,
  
  
 [Interlude]
  
  
   And never deleting
  
  
 [Verse]
  
   When I saw you, everyone knew I
   Liked the affect that you had on my eyes
   But no one else heard the way of your words or
   Felt the affect that they have on my mind
   Falling, mmmmm
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   I know cause i've spent half this morning

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
       It's four in the morning, the end of December
      I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
 New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
          There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening
   I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
   You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
           Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
      She said that you gave it to her that night that you planned to go clear
   Did you ever go clear?
  
  
 [Verse 2]
          Ah, the last time we saw you, you looked so much older
       Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
        You'd been to the station to meet every train
      And you came home without Lili Marlene
          And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
   And when she came back, she was nobody's wife
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
          Well, I see you there with the rose in your teeth
                      One more thin gypsy thief, well, I see Jane's awake
   She sends her regards
  
  
 [Verse 3]
      And what can I tell you my brother, my killer?
 What can I possibly say?
    I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you
      I'm glad you stood in my way
   If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me
   Well, your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free
  
  
 [Chorus 3]
           Yes, and thanks for the trouble you took from her eyes
                   I thought it was there for good, so I never tried
      And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
      She said that you gave it to her that night that you planned to go clear

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
 (Cocker's version is a lot slower than the Beatles
 and isn't exactly the same.)
  
 What would you do if I sang out of tune,  
            would you stand up and walk out on me? 
               Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song  
           and I'll try not to sing out of key. 
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Oh, I'm gonna get by with a little help from my friends. 
                      I just keep trying, high with a little help from my friends. 
                    I wanna get high, high with a little help from my friends. 
              I just hold on with my friends. 
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 What do I do when my love is away? 
          Does it worry you to be alone? Oh no! 
           How do I feel by the end of the day ? 
          Are you sad because you're on your own? (I don't get sad!) 
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Oh, I'm gonna get by with a little help from my friends. 
                      I just keep trying, high with a little help from my friends. 
                    I wanna get high, high with a little help from my friends. 
              I just hold on with my friends. 
  
 Do you need anybody?...I need somebody to love. 
                 Could it be anybody? All I need is someone, 
 Lord, I need someone...I want somebody to love.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Oh, I'm gonna get by with a little help from my friends. 
                      I just keep trying, high with a little help from my friends. 
                    I wanna get high, high with a little help from my friends. 
              I just hold on with my friends. 
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 Would you believe in a love at first sight? 
      I'm certain that it happens all the time. 
       What do you see when you turn out the light? 
          I don't see too much, but I know it's mine. 
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Oh, I'm gonna get by with a little help from my friends.

                    I wanna get high, high with a little help from my friends. 
              I just hold on with my friends. 
  
 Do you need anybody?...I need somebody to love.
                 Could it be anybody? All I need is someone, 
 Lord, I need someone...I want somebody to love. 
  
  
 [Chorus] x2
  
 Oh, I'm gonna get by with a little help from my friends.

 [Verse]
            When the sun goes down on my side of town
        That lonesome feelin' comes to my door
             An' the whole world turns... blue
             There's a rundown bar across the railroad tracks
          I got a table for two, way in the back
        Where I sit alone... and I think of losin' you
               I spend most every night beneath the light of a neon moon

 [Verse]
             I think of two young lovers a-runnin' wild and free
         I close my eyes and sometimes see
     You in the shadows of this smoke-filled room
              No tellin' how many tears I've sat here and cried
       Or how many lies that I've lied 
          Tellin' my poor heart she'll come back someday
               Oh, but I'll be alright as long as there's light from a neon moon

 I've made up my mind,
 Don't need to think it over,
 If I'm wrong I am right,
 Don't need to look no further,
 This ain't lust,
          I know this is love but,
 If I tell the world,
 I'll never say enough,

 should I leave it there?

      I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
     Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
 Truly I ain't got no business here
      But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
      But really I would rather be at home all by myself
              Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
    I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
     So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
          I'll be here, Somewhere in the corner
        Under clouds of marijuana, With this boy who's hollering
               I can hardly hear, Over this music I don't listen to
      And I don't wanna get with you, So tell my friends that I'll be over here

      And I know you mean only the best and your
    Intentions aren't to bother me, But honestly I'd rather be
 Somewhere with my people, We can kick it and just listen to
       Some music with a message, like we usually do
                        And we'll discuss our big dreams, How we plan to take over the planet
     So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
 Not there in the kitchen, With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
                       So tell them I'll be here, Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
                                    Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
                  Oh God why am I here?
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
           Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
       Oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
           Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
              And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
 Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
      How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
    E                                                (mute until Dm)
 So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
                                            I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
                 And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
                                 So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
          And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
                  Yo I'll be over here
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
           Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
       Oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
           Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
              And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
            If you're ready then I'm ready yeah yeah
            If you're ready then I'm ready yeah yeah

 The Beatles  1967 (Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band)
  
 Picture yourself in a boat on a river
       With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
 Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
    A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
  
 Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, towering over your head
 Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone
  
 Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
 Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.
  
 Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
        Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies,
 Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
       That grow so incredibly high.
  
 Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
 Waiting to take you away.
 Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
             And you're gone.
  
 Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
 Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.
  
 Picture yourself on a train in a station,
       With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
 Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
      The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
  
 Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
 Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhh. 6x

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Words like violence
 Break the silence
 Come crashing in
 Into my little world
 Painful to me
 Pierce right through me
 Can't you understand
 Oh my little girl
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 All I ever wanted
 All I ever needed
 Is here in my arms
 Words are very unnecessary
 They can only do harm
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Vows are spoken
 To be broken
 Feelings are intense
 Words are trivial
 Pleasures remain
 So does the pain
 Words are meaningless
 And forgettable

 All I ever wanted
 All I ever needed
 Is here in my arms

           Spend all your time waiting for that second chance
           For the break that would make it okay
                         There's always some reason to feel not good enough
           And it's hard at the end of the day
                  I need some distraction, a beautiful release
 Memories seep from my veins
              Let me be empty, oh and weightless, and maybe
       I'll find some peace tonight

 [Verse 2]
  
                      So tired of this straight line, and everywhere you turn
             There's vultures and theives at your back
                       The storm keeps on twisting, you keep on building the lies
             That you make up for all that you lack.
                      It don't make no difference, escaping one last time
      It's easier to believe
                   In this sweet madness, oh this glorious sadness
        That brings me to my knees.

  So no one told you life was gonna be this way
  Your job's a joke, you're broke
        Your love life's D.O.A.
  
 [Pre-chorus]
  It's like you're always stuck in second gear
          When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month
                Or even your year, but
  
 [Chorus]
  I'll be there for you
             When the rain starts to pour
            I'll be there for you
                   Like I've been there before
  I'll be there for you

 [Verse 2]
  You're still in bed at ten
       And work began at eight
  You've burned your breakfast
            So far, things are going great
  
 [Pre-chorus]
  Your mother warned you there'd be days like these
               Oh but she didn't tell you when the world has brought
                     You down to your knees that

  I'll be there for you
                  'Cause you're there for me too
  
 [Bridge]
  No one could ever know me
  No one could ever see me
  Seems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me
  Someone to face the day with
  Make it through all the rest with
  Someone I'll always laugh with
 Even under the worst I'm best with you
  
 [Pre-chorus]
  It's like you're always stuck in second gear
          When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month
                Or even your year, but

      Dan kau kutinggalkan
  
  Betapa hatiku bersedih
  Mengenang kasih dan sayangmu
  Setulus pesanmu kepadaku
     Engkau kan menunggu
  
 [Chorus]
  Andaikan kau datang kemari
  Jawaban apa yang kan kuberi
  Adakah jalan yang kau temui
    Untuk kita kembali lagi
  
  Bersinarlah bulan purnama
  Seindah serta tulus cintanya
  Bersinarlah terus sampai nanti
    Lagu ini kuakhiri

  Mengenang kasih dan sayangmu
  Setulus pesanmu kepadaku
     Engkau kan menunggu

 Capo 1
  
 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
   How much of my mother has my mother left in me
   How much of my love will be insane to some degree
        And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough
          Will it wash out in the water or is it always in the blood
  
  
 [Verse 2]
   How much of my father am I destined to become
         Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone
          Will I let this woman kill me or do away with jealous love
          Will it wash out in the water or is it always in the blood
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
         I can feel the love I want, I can feel the love I need
           But it's never gonna come the way I am
           Could I change it if I wanted, can I rise above the flood
          Will it wash out in the water or is it always in the blood
  
  
 [Verse 3]
   How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be
           Does a broken home become another broken family
             Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could
           Will it wash out in the water or is it always in the blood
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
         I can feel the love I want, I can feel the love I need

 [Verse 1]
  
      Its nine o’clock on a saturday
      The regular crowd shuffles in
             There’s an old man  sitting next to me
          Making love to his tonic and gin

          He says son can you play me a memory
       I’m not really sure how it goes

       when I wore a younger man’s clothes

      Now john at the bar is a friend of mine
     He gets me my drinks for free
           And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
              But there's someplace that he'd rather be
  
            He says, ""bill, i believe this is killing me.""
         As the smile ran away from his face
            ""well i'm sure that i could be a movie star
     If i could get out of this place""

      Who never had time for a wife
           And he's talkin' with davy who's still in the navy
      And probably will be for life
  
          And the waitress is practicing politics
         As the businessmen slowly get stoned
               Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness

 If you have any questions of opinions just email me on: moixe10@hotmail.com
  
  
 First thing you must do is to down tune you guitar a half step.
  
 The tuning of this song is | D# G# C# F# A# D# |
  
 then the chords are power chords but you play on all the strings and you must let
 all the strings ring out clearly.
  
 for example: when you play the first chords wich is an E you play on ALL the strings
 when you hold down the power chord and you let the other strings that are open ring out!
 I hope you understand how I mean :)
  
 and just listen to song for the strumming pattern.
  
 well well, here's the chords:
  
      D#|--0----0----0----0----0----0---|
 A#|--0----0----0----0----0----0---|
 F#|--9----8----11---6----4----9---|
 C#|--9----9----12---7----5----10--|
 G#|--7----9----12---7----5----10--|
 D#|--0----7----10---5----3----8---|
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 Look at this Photograph, everytime I do it makes me laugh,
                          How did our eyes get so red, and what the hell is on Joey's head?
                           And this is where I grew up, I think the present owner fixed it up,
                               I never knew we ever went without,the second floor is high for sneakin' out.
                               And this is where I went to school, most of the time had better things to do,
                                  Criminal record says I broke in twice, I must have done half a dozen times.
                        I wonder if it's too late, should I go back and try to graduate,
                                     Life's better now than it was back then, if I was them I wouldn't let me
 in...Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
       Every memory of lookin out the back door, I had the photo album spread
                                out on my bedroom floor, It's hard to say it, time to say it
 Good-bye, Good-bye.
        Every memory of walkin out the front door, I found the photo of the friend
                               that I was looking for, It's hard to say it, time to say it
 Good-Bye, Good-Bye.
  
  
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Remember the old arcade? Blew every dollar that we ever made.
                            The Cops hated us hangin' out, they say somebody went and burned it down.
                            We use to listen to the radio and sing along with every song we'd know.
                                       We said someday we'd find out how it feels to sing to more than just the
           steering wheel. Kim's the first girl I kissed. I was so nervous that I nearly missed.
                                   She's had a couple of kids since then. I haven't seen her since god knows
 when... Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
        Every memory of lookin out the back door, I had the photo album spread
                                out on my bedroom floor, It's hard to say it, time to say it
 Good-bye, Good-bye.
        Every memory of walkin out the front door, I found the photo of the friend
                               that I was looking for, It's hard to say it, time to say it
 Good-Bye, Good-Bye.
  
  
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 I miss that time, I miss their faces
              You can't erase, You can't replace it.
             I miss it now. I can't believe it.
              So hard to stay. To hard to leave it.
  
 If I could relive those days I know the one thing that would never change...
  
  
 [Final chorus]
  
        Every memory of lookin out the back door, I had the photo album spread
                                out on my bedroom floor, It's hard to say it, time to say it

 forgetting all i'm lacking
 completely incomplete
 i'll take your invitation
 you take all of me

         now.. i'm falling even more in love with you
 letting go of all i've held on to
                     i'm standing here until you make me move
                  i'm hanging by a moment here with you
  
        i'm living for the only thing i know
 i'm running and not quite sure where to go
                     i don't know what i'm diving into
                 just hanging by a moment here with you

                         there's nothing else to lose
                 nothing left to find
                     there's nothing in the world
                     that could change my mind
            there is nothing else
           there is nothing else...

         In the night I hear them talk
              The coldest story ever told
            Somewhere far along this road
              He lost his soul
                          To a woman so heartless

 How could you be so
 Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
 Just remember that you talking to me yo
              You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
  
 I mean after all the things that we been through
 I mean after all the things we got into
 And yo I know some things you things that you ain't told me
        Ayo I did some things but that's the old me
  
 And now you wanna pay me back, and you gon' show me
 So you walk round like you don't me
 You got them new friends, well I got homeys
             But at the end its still so lonely

 Homie i dont know, she's hot and cold
 I wont stop, i wont mess my groove up
 Cause i already know how this thing go

 You wait a couple months then you gon' see
 You'll never find nobody better than me

 So I got something new to see
 And you just gon' keep hatin' me
 And we just gon' be enemies

 Honey Pie chords
 The Beatles *
  
 She was a working girl
 North of England way
 Now she's in the big time
 In  the  USA
 And if she could only hear me
 This is what I'd say:
  
 Honey Pie, you are making me crazy             
 I'm in love but I'm lazy
 So won't you please come home         Oh
 Honey Pie,
                 My position is tragic
 Come and show me the magic
 Of your Hollywood Song
  
 You became a legend of the silver screen
 And now the thought of meeting you
 Makes me weak in the knees        Oh
  
 Honey Pie,
                     You are driving me frantic
 Sail across the Atlantic
 To be where you belong
        Honey Pie, co me back to me
  
 Solo: (Guitar)
  
 Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
 Kindly send her sailing back to me
 T. T. Tee!  Now
 Honey Pie
                    You are making me crazy             
 I'm in love but I'm lazy                
 So won't you please come home
 Come, come back to me Honey Pie, Ha ha ha

0,Going To California chords,Going To California – Led Zeppelin," 
 Spent my days with a woman unkind,
                                     Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
 Made up my mind to make a new start,
                                              Going to california with an aching in my heart.
 Someone told me theres a girl out there
                                            With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
  
 Took my chances on a big jet plane,
                                                 Never let them tell you that theyre all the same.
 The sea was red and the sky was grey,
                                             Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
      The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
                                        As the children of the sun began to awake.
 Seems that the wrath of the gods
  
 Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
                       I think I might be sinking.
 Throw me a line if I reach it in time
  
 Ill meet you up there where the path
                    Runs straight and high.
  
  
 To find a queen without a king;
                                                They say she plays guitar and cries as she sings.
 Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn

      You know I'm not one to break promises
       I don't want to hurt you but I need to breathe
      At the end of it all, you're still my best friend
      But there's something inside that I need to release
 Which way is right, which way is wrong
 How do I say that I need to move on
      You know we are headed separate_ways

 [Verse]
  
       All alone at the end of the evening
          and the bright lights have faded to blue.
        I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have loved me,
              but I never knew.
     You know I've always been a dreamer (spend my life runnin' round)
           and it's so hard to change (can't seem to settle down)
          but the dreams I've seen lately   keep on turnin' out
      and burnin' out and turnin' out the sa - me.

          You can spend all your time making money,

        If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
                     would you still be mine?
     And when you're looking for your freedom (nobody seems to care)
                         And you can't find the door (can't find it anywhere)
               when there's nothing to believe in   still you're coming back,
         you're running back, you're coming back for mo - re.

 [Verse]
  
 I want to live where soul meets body
 And let the sun wrap its arms around me
 And bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing
      And feel, feel what its like to be new
  
                             Cause in my head there’s a greyhound station
 Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
 So they may have a chance of finding a place
                where they’re far more suited than here
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 I do believe it’s true
                 That there are roads left in both of our shoes
         If the silence takes you
         Then I hope it takes me too

 [Verse 1]
   After all the jacks are in their boxes
          And the clowns have all gone to bed
          You can hear happiness    staggering on down the street
 Footprints dressed in red
          And the wind whispers Mary
  
 [Verse 2]
   A broom is drearily sweeping
         Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
      Somewhere a Queen is weeping
      Somewhere a King has no wife
          And the wind it cries Mary

            Cause the life that they lived is dead
          And the wind screams Mary
  
 [Verse 4]
   Will the wind ever remember
      The names it has blown in the past
                And with this crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
                 It whispers “No, this will be the last”
          And the wind cries Mary

 [Verse 1]
  
 Theres still a little bit of your taste,    in my mouth
 Still a little bit of you laced,     with my doubt
 It's still a little hard to say,
          What's going on
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 There's still a little bit of your ghost, your weakness
 There's still a little bit of your face,   I haven't kissed
 You step a little closer each day,  that I can't say
 What's going on
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Stones, taught me to fly
 Love, it taught me to lie
 Life,   it taught me to die
           So it's not hard to fall
        When you float like a cannon - ball
  
  
 (repeat intro)
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 There's still a little bit of your song, in my ear
 Theres still a little bit of your words I long to hear
 You step a little closer to me
 SO close that I cant see whats going on
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Stones, taught me to fly
 Love, it taught me to lie
 Life,   it taught me to die
           So it's not hard to fall
        When you float like a cannon...
  
 Stones, taught me to fly
 Love, it taught me to cry
              So come on courage, teach me to be shy
                  'Cause it's not hard to fall
         And I don't wanna scare her
                  'Cause it's not hard to fall
        And I don't wanna lose
         It's not hard to grow
            When you know that you just don't know
  
  
 (repeat intro to end)
  
  
 For intro you can also just play chords if you find intro too difficult.

 You think you own whatever land you land on
      The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
      But I know every rock and tree and creature
        has a life, has a spirit, has a name.
      You think the only people who are people
          are the people who look and think like you
      But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
               you'll learn things you never knew you never knew.
  
 [Chorus]
 Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
     Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
          Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
          Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
          Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
  
 [Verse 2]
       Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
       Come taste the sun sweet berries of the earth
       Come roll in all the riches all around you
          And for once never wonder what they're worth.
      The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
      The heron and the otter are my friends
      And we are all connected to each other
       In a circle in a hoop that never ends.
  
 [Chorus]
 Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
     or let the eagle tell you where he's been?
          Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
          Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
          Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
  
 How high does the sycamore grow?
         If you cut it down then you'll never know.
  
 [Verse]
 And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
      For whether we are white or copper skinned
             We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
             We need to paint with all the colors of the wind.

 [VERSE 1 - ZAYN]
  
                       Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
                      But bear this in mind, it was meant to be
                          And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
                         And it all makes sense to me
  
  
 [VERSE 2 - LIAM]
  
                    I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
                           When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
                      The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
                           But I'll love them endlessly 
  
  
 [CHORUS]
  
         I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
                           But if I do, it's you - oh it's you, they add up to
                         I'm in love with you, and all these little things
  
  
 [VERSE 3 - LOUIS]
  
                  You can't go to bed, without a cup of tea
                      And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
                      And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
                            Though it makes no sense to me
  
  
 [VERSE 4 - HARRY]
  
                    I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
  
         You never want to know how much you weigh
                  You still have to squeeze into your jeans
                      But you're perfect to me
  
  
 [CHORUS]
  
         I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth

                         I'm in love with you, and all these little things
  
  
  
 [BRIDGE - NIALL]
  
 (         You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you
         And you'll never treat yourself right darlin', but I want you to
         If I let you know I'm here for you
         Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

 Whenever I see girls and boys

      I remember the Child
       In the manger as He sleeps
 Wherever there are people
    Giving gifts, exchanging cards
       I believe that Christmas
     Is truly in their hearts

       dan ijinkan aku memeluk dirimu kali ini saja
      tuk ucapkan selamat tinggal untuk selamanya
      dan biarkan rasa ini bahagia untuk sekejab saja

 [Verse 1]
  When I was a young boy,       said put away those young boy ways
  Now that I'm gettin' older, so much older   I love all those young boy days.
  With a girl like you,     with a girl like you,
    Lord knows there are things we can do, baby,
 Just me and you, Come on and make it . . .

 Änglarna har åkt på pisk
              Gårdarna är grönsvarta
           Och i Azalea kan man inte undgå att bli kär
 Där går en som svär att allt du gör är gott (mmm)
 Ja, jag är din om du vill ha en idiot
                  Lägg din hand i min, lägg din hand i min
  
 Har ingen plats att kalla hem
          I detta pissiga vårregn
 Ett förortsgäng kapar en spårvagn hem i vårkvällen
 Provsmakar livets heroin
      Och om du någonsin vill ha en idiot
                    Lägg din hand i min, lägg din hand i min
  
 Du kanske aldrig når dit du vill nå
             men du når mig
 Du kanske aldrig får den du vill få
         men du får mig

 [Verse]
 I walk the streets of Japan till I get lost
 Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
 With a graveyard tan carrying a cross
 Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
 I like studying faces in a parking lot
 Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
 I like driving backwards in the fog
 Cause it doesn't remind me of anything

      The things that I've loved, the things that I've lost

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse]
 I stand before you, accused of many crimes
 But I want to believe that love can still survive
 You don’t have to say it, I don’t have to read your mind
 To know that emptiness has finally arrived
 How was I to know right from wrong
 Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong?
  
 [Chorus]
          Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
           Looking into my eyes, honestly...
  
 [Verse]
 Words have more meaning if they’ve said at certain times
 I need you now so I can feel alive
 How would you know if you won't give me some time
               To see if everything could work out you’d be mine
      Oh will love be lost forever or someday I will find
                 The words that I’ve been searching for
        Or just some peace of mind
  
 [Chorus]
          Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
           Looking into my eyes, honestly
          Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
           Looking into my eyes, honestly
  
 Yeah...yeah...yeah

 All the nights I sit and wonder
 There must be more to life; I’m sure that
 days and years go by while I am
 living with a, living lonely feeling
  
 [Chorus]
 Honestly, if you're still loving me
           Looking into my eyes, honestly  
          Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
             Looking into my eyes, honestly.

 MINE
  
  You were in college working part time waiting tables
  Left a small town, never looked back
  I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
 Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
  
   I say can you believe it?
  As we're lying on the couch
      The moment I could see it
 Yes, yes, I can see it now
  
  Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
  You put your arm around me for the first time
  You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
  You are the best thing that's ever been mine
  
  Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
  And there's a drawer of my things at your place
  You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
  You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
  
      But we got bills to pay
      We got nothing figured out
      When it was hard to take
 Yes, yes, this is what I thought about
  
  Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
  You put your arm around me for the first time
  You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
  You are the best thing that's ever been mine
  Do you remember all the city lights on the water
  You saw me start to believe for the first time
  You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
  You are the best thing that's ever been mine
  
  
          And I remember that fight, two thirty AM
      You said everything was slipping out of our hands
 I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
    Braced myself for the goodbye
    'Cause that's all I've ever known
    And you took me by suprise
    You said I'll never leave you alone
  
 You said
  I remember how we felt sitting by the water
  And every time I look at you it's like the first time
  I fell in love with a careless man’s careful daughter
  She is the best thing that’s ever been mine
  
 Hold on, we can make it last
 Hold on, never turn back
  You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
  You are the best thing that's ever been mine
 (Hold on) Do you believe it?
 (Hold on) We’re gonna make it now
 (Hold on) And I can see it
 Yeah, yeah (I can see it now, see it now, see it now)

 SPARKS FLY
 Capo 5
  
  The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
  And I'm a house of cards
              You're the kind of reckless that should send me running
         But I kinda know that I won't get far
  
  And you stood there in front of me just
  Close enough to touch
  Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of
  
  
                  Drop everything now
                 Meet me in the pouring rain
 Kiss me on the sidewalk
 Take away the pain
         'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
                    Get me with those green eyes, baby
         As the lights go down
          Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
         'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
  
  
  My mind forgets to remind me
  You're a bad idea
  You touch me once and it's really something
        You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
  
  
  I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
              But with you I know it's no good
  And I could wait patiently but
  I really wish you would
  
  
                  Drop everything now
                 Meet me in the pouring rain
 Kiss me on the sidewalk
 Take away the pain
         'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
                    Get me with those green eyes, baby
         As the lights go down
          Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
         'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
  
  
    I run my fingers through your hair
      And watch the lights go wild
       Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
            It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
      And lead me up the staircase
            Won't you whisper soft and slow
      I'm captivated by you baby like a fireworks show
  
  
                 Drop everything now
                 Meet me in the pouring rain
 Kiss me on the sidewalk
 Take away the pain
         'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
                    Get me with those green eyes, baby
         As the lights go down
          Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
         'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
            And the sparks fly, baby smile, and the sparks fly

 BACK TO DECEMBER
  
 I'm so glad you made the time to see me
 How's life, tell me how's your family
 I haven't seen them in a while
 You've been good, busier than ever
 We small talk, work and the weather
 You're guard is up, and I know why
  
 Because the last time you saw me
             It's still burned in the back of your mind 
              You gave me roses and I left them there to die
  
     So this is me swallowing my pride 
              Standing in front of you saying 
                      ""I'm sorry for that night"" and I go 
 Back to December all the time
     It turns out freedom ain't
 ( Nothing but missing you
 Wishing I'd realized what I had 
       When you were mine 
         I'd go back to December, 
 Turn around and make it all right
       I go back to December all the time
  
  
  
 These days I haven't been sleeping
 Stayin' up playing back myself leaving
 When your birthday passed and I didn't call
         Then I think about summer all the beautiful times 
 I watch you laughing from the passenger side
 And realized I loved you in the fall
  
 And then the cold came the dark days
       When fear crept into my mind
              You gave me all your love and
        All I gave you was goodbye
  
  
     So this is me swallowing my pride 
              Standing in front of you saying 
                      ""I'm sorry for that night"" and I go 
 Back to December all the time
     It turns out freedom ain't
 ( Nothing but missing you
 Wishing I'd realized what I had 
       When you were mine 
         I'd go back to December, 
 Turn around and change my own mind
       I go back to December all the time
  
  
  
              I miss your tan skin your sweet smile
     So good to me, so right
              And how you held me in your arms
                 That September night
                     The first time you ever saw me cry
                                Maybe this is wishful thinking
                            Probably mindless dreaming
 ( If you loved again I swear I'd love you right
  
         I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
            So if the chain is on your door I understand
  
      But this is me swallowing my pride 
              Standing in front of you saying 
                      ""I'm sorry for that night"" and I go 
 Back to December...
     It turns out freedom ain't
 ( Nothing but missing you
 Wishing I'd realized what I had 
       When you were mine 
         I'd go back to December 
 Turn around and make it all right
         I'd go back to December
 Turn around and change my own mind
       I go back to December all the time
  
         All the time

 SPEAK NOW
  
 I am not the kind of girl 
                Who should be rudely barging in
       On a white veil occasion 
      But you are not the kind of boy 
                Who should be marrying the wrong girl
  
 I sneak in and see your friends 
          And her snotty little family 
      All dressed in pastel 
      And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
            Somewhere back inside a room 
            Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
  
 Thi--is i---is surely not 
                            What you thought it would be
 I---I  lose myself in a daydream
 n. Where I stand and say
  
  
 Don't say ""Yes"" run away now
 I'll meet you when your out 
         Of the church at the back door
                Don't wait or say a single vow 
 You need to hear me out
           And they said ""Speak Now""
  
  
  
  
 Fond gestures are exchanged 
          And the organ starts to play a song 
       That sounds like a death march
      And I am hiding in the curtains
                It seems that I was uninvited 
          By your lovely bride-to-be
  
 She---e floats down the aisle 
         Like a pageant queen 
      But I--I kno--ow 
      You wish it was me
      You wish it was me- Don't you?
  
  
  
 Don't say ""Yes"" run away now
 I'll meet you when your out 
         Of the church at the back door
                Don't wait or say a single vow 
 You need to hear me out
           And they said ""Speak Now""
                  Don't say ""Yes"" run away now
 I'll meet you when your out 
         Of the church at the back door
                Don't wait or say a single vow 
 Your time is running out
           And they said ""Speak Now""
  
    Ohooho laaaahhoh
 Oooh(Say you see me now)ooohooh
  
  
 I hear the preacher say speak now 
             Or forever hold your pe---ace
 There's a silence, there's my last chance 
 I stand up with shaky hands 
      All eyes on me
 Horrified looks from everyone in the room
      But I'm only lookin' at you
  
  
  
 I am not the kind of girl 
                Who should be rudely barging in
       On a white veil occasion 
      But you are not the kind of boy 
                Who should be marrying the wrong girl
  
  
        Oops! Don't say ""Yes"" run away now
 I'll meet you when your out 
         Of the church at the back door
                Don't wait or say a single vow 
 You need to hear me out
       They said ""Speak Now""
                    And you say ""Lets run away now""
       I'll meet you when I'm out
        Of my tux at the back door
         Baby I didn't say my vows
     So glad you were around
            When they said ""Speak no--ow""
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
 DEAR JOHN
  
  
 Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
 Counting my footsteps, prayin' the floor won't fall through, again
 My mother accused me of losing my mind
        But I swore I was fine
  
  
 You paint me a blue sky and go back and turn it to rain
        And I lived in your chess game but you changed the rules every day
 Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight.
         Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why
  
  
       Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
                            Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
      The girl in the dress cried the whole way home.
            I shoulda known.
  
  
       Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame.
             Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away.
      And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
      Who don't understand.
                And I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said
          ""Run as fast as you can.""
  
  
       Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
                            Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
      The girl in the dress cried the whole way home.
  
  
       Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong.
                                 Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by your dark twisted games 
         When I loved you so?
            I shoulda known.
  
  
             You are an expert at sorry
      And keeping lines blurry
      And never impressed by me acing your tests
          All the girls that you run dry
       Have tired lifeless eyes
             'Cause you burned them out
      But I took your matches
    Before fire could catch me
     So don't look now
      I'm shining like fireworks
 Over your sad empty town
  
  
       Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
                            Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
      The girl in the dress cried the whole way home.
  
  
     I see it all now that you're gone.
                            Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
      The girl in the dress wrote you a song.
  
              You shoulda known.
              You shoulda known.
      Don't you think I was too young?
                     You shoulda known.

 MEAN
 Capo 2
 You, with your words like knives and swords
                       And weapons that you use against me 
 You, have knocked me off my feet again
         Got me feelin' like a nothin'
 You, with your voice like nails on a chalk board
             Callin' me out when I'm wounded
 You, pickin' on the weaker man
  
       Well you can take me down with just one single blow
      But you don't know, what you don't know...
  
  
  
 Someday I'll be livin in a big ol' city 
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 (no chord)         D
 Why you gotta be so mean?
  
  
 You, with your swithching sides and
       Your wild fire lies and your humiliation
 You, have pointed out my flaws again
       -stop
 As if I don't already see them
 I walk with my head down
            tryin' to block you out 
           'cause I never impress you
 I just wanna feel okay again
  
 I bet you got pushed around
 Somebody made you  cold
 ( But the cycle ends right now 'cause
 You can't lead me down that road
 And you don't know what you don't know
  
  
 Someday I'll be livin in a big ol' city 
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean
                     Why you gotta be so mean?
  
  
              And I can't see you years from now in a bar
  Talkin' over a football game
 ( With that same big loud opinion
 But no one's listening
 ( Washed up and ranting about the 
 same old   bitter   things
 Drunk and grumblin' all about how I  can't sing
 -no chord          But all you are is mean
 ( All you are is mean...and a liar...and pathetic
      And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
  
 (*Palm mute*)
      But someday I'll be livin in a big ol' city 
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean,  yeah--ah
 Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 ( Why you gotta be so...Someday
 I'll be livin in a big ol' city (why ya gotta be so mean)
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean (why ya gotta be so mean)
 Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (why ya gotta be so mean)
      And all you're ever gonna be is mean
                     Why you gotta be so  mean?

 THE STORY OF US
 Capo 2
 -Intro-
  
  
 I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
                                          How we met and the sparks flew instantly
               People would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
 I used to know my place was a spot next to you
                                              Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
                             'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
  
  
 Oh, a simple complication
            Miscommunications lead to fall out
 So many things that I wish you knew
 So many walls up I can't break through
  
  
 Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
                And we're not speaking
                   And I'm dying to know is it killing you
                    Like it's killing me?
 I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
                    When it all broke down
          And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now-  Next chapter
  
  
  
  
 How'd we end up this way?
                   See me nervously pulling at my clothes
                         And trying to look busy
                        And you're doing your best to avoid me
  
 I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
                                              How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
                    But you held your pride like you should have held me
  
  
 Oh, we're scared to see the ending
             Why are we pretending this is nothing?
 I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
 I've never heard silence quite this loud
  
  
 Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
                And we're not speaking
                   And I'm dying to know is it killing you
                    Like it's killing me?
 I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
                    When it all broke down
          And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
  
  
  
     This is looking like a contest
 ( Of who can act like they care less
 But I liked it better when you were on my side
 The battle's in your hands now
 ( But I would lay my armor down
     If you'd say you'd rather love than fight
  
  
 So many things that you wish I knew
          But the story of us might be ending soon
  
  
   Now I'm standing alone 
         In a crowded room  and we're not speaking                    
          And I'm dying to know is it killing you
                    Like it's killing me?
 I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
                    When it all broke down
          And the story of us 
          Looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, no-----ow
    And we're not speaking
                   And I'm dying to know is it killing you
                    Like it's killing me?
 I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
                      'Cause we're go-ing down
          And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
  
 The End.

 NEVER GROW UP
 -Intro-
  
  
 Your little hands wrapped around my finger
           And it's so quiet in the world tonight
 Your little eyelids 
 Flutter cause you're dreaming
       So I tuck you in 
               Turn on your favorite night light
  
 To you, everything's funny
                       You got nothing to regret
                           I'd give all I have honey
 ( If you could stay like that
  
  
 Oohhh darling don't you ever grow up, 
            Don't you ever grow up
       Just stay this little
      Ohh darling don't you ever grow up, 
            Don't you ever grow up
           It could stay this simple
  
                             I won't let nobody hurt you
                             Wont let no one break your heart
                        No one will desert you
                         Just try to never grow up
             Never grow up
  
  
 You're in the car on the way to the movies
             And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
 At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
                And you can't wait to move out
              Someday and call your own shots
  
 But don't make her drop you off around the block
                                    Remember that she's getting older too
 ( And don't lose the way that you dance 
   Around in your PJs getting ready for school
  
  
  
 Oh darling don't you ever grow up, 
            Don't you ever grow up
       Just stay this little
     Oh darling don't you ever grow up, 
            Don't you ever grow up
            It could stay this simple
                           And no one's ever burned you
                         Nothin's ever left you scarred
                             And even though you want to
                         Just try to never grow up
  
  
  
 Take pictures in your mind of your childhood rooOOoom
                   Memorize what is sounded like what your dad gets home
                   Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
               And all your little brother's favorite songs
 I just realized everything I had is someday gonna be gone
  
 So here I am in my new apartment
       In a big city, they just dropped me off
 It's so much colder than I thought it would be
       So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
  
  
                       Wish I'd never grown up
             I wish I'd never grown up
  
 Ohhh, I don't want to grow up
           Wish I'd never grown up
        Could still be little
 Ooohh I don't want to grow up 
           Wish I'd never grown up 
           It could still be simple
  
     Oh darling don't you ever grow up, 
            Don't you ever grow up
       Just stay this little
     Oh darling don't you ever grow up, 
            Don't you ever grow up
           It could stay this simple
  
   Ooooh, I won't let nobody hurt you
            Won't let no one break your heart
      And even though you want too
         Please try to never grow up
  
 Ohhhohoh,ohhoh, don't you ever grow up
 Ohhhoh,(never grow up) just never grow up

 ENCHANTED
 Capo 1
 Intro:   
 Verse 1
  
 There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
 Same old tired, lonely place
 Walls of insincerity Shifiting eyes and vancancy 
 vanished when I saw your face
                       All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
 Your eyes whispered ""have we met?""
 Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
      The playful conversation starts Counter all your quick remarks 
        like passing notes in secrecy
          And it was enchanting to meet you
                      All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
  
 Chorus:
  
  This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
              I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
                I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
                      I was enchanted to meet you
  
 Verse 2
  
        The lingering question kept me up 2am, who do you love?
    I wonder till I'm wide awake
 Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
        I'd open up and you would say,
          It was enchanting to meet you
                      All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
  
 Chorus
  
  This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
              I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
                I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
  This night is flawless, don't you let it go
            I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
                I'll spend forever wondering if you know
                      I was enchanted to meet you
  
 Solo:
  
 Bridge
                          This is me praying that this was the very first page
                 Not where the story line ends
                              My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
                             These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
                     I was enchanted to meet you
 Please don't be in love with someone else
 Please don't have somebody waiting on you
 Please don't be in love with someone else
 Please don't have somebody waiting on you
  
 Chorus
  
  This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
              I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home

  This night is flawless, don't you let it go
            I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
                I'll spend forever wondering if you know
                      I was enchanted to meet you

 BETTER THAN REVENGE
 Capo 2
 Intro:   
 The story starts when it was hot and it was Summer
          And, I had it all; I had him right there where I wanted him
 She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
 She took him faster than you can say sabotage
 I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
 I underestimated just who I was dealing with
 She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum 
 She underestimated just who she was stealing from 
  
  
 She's not a saint and she's not what you think 
                  She's an actress, Whoa
 She's better known for the things that she does 
                  on the mattress, Whoa
 Soon she's gonna find 
                  Stealing other people's toys on the playground 
                                             Won't make you many friends 
 She should keep in mind,
 She should keep in mind 
                                There is nothing I do better than revenge, Ha 
  
  
 She lives her life like it's a party and she's on the list 
 She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it 
 I think her ever present frown is a little troubling 
             And, she thinks I'm psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but 
 Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know 
 or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go 
 Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me 
 But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity 
  
  
 She's not a saint and she's not what you think 
                  She's an actress, Whoa
 She's better known for the things that she does 
                  on the mattress, Whoa
 Soon she's gonna find 
                  Stealing other people's toys on the playground 
                                             Won't make you many friends 
 She should keep in mind,
 She should keep in mind 
                                There is nothing I do better than revenge, Ha ha
  
  
 I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey 
          You might have him, but haven't you heard 
        I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
           You might have him, but I always get the last word     Whoa
  
  
 She's not a saint and she's not what you think 
                  She's an actress, Whoa
 She's better known for the things that she does 
                  on the mattress, Whoa
 Soon she's gonna find 
                  Stealing other people's toys on the playground 
                                             Won't make you many friends 
 She should keep in mind,
 She should keep in mind 
                                There is nothing I do better than revenge
  
                        And do you still feel like you know what you're doing, 
            Cause I don't think you do, Oh 
                Do you still feel like you know what you're doing 
 I don't think you do, I don't think you do 
 ( Let's hear the applause 
                                  C'mon show me how much better you are 
 See you deserve some applause 
                           Cause you're so much better 
 She took him faster than you can say sabotage

 INNOCENT
 Capo 4
 Intro:   
  
    I guess you really did it this time
           Left yourself in your war path
            Lost your balance on a tightrope
            Lost your mind trying to get it back
  
            Wasn't it easi--er in your lunchbox days?
           Always a bigger bed, to crawl into
            Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
   And everybody believed in you
  
  
  It's alright, just wait and see your,
 String of lights are still bright to me, oh
                                    Who you are is not what you've been, 
                           You're still an innocent
                           You're still an innocent
  
  
   Did some things you can't speak of
        But tonight you'll live it all again
                  You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
                  If only you had seen what you know now then
  
  
            Wasn't it easi--er in your firefly catching days?
                 And everything out of reach 
                                    Someone bigger brought down to you
            Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'till you fell asleep
                      Before the monsters caught up to you
  
  
  It's alright just wait and see your,
                                              String of lights are still bright to me, oh
                                      Who you are is not what you've been,  
                          You're still an innocent
  
                                  It's okay, life is a tough crowd,  
                                      Thirty-two and still growing up now
                                 Who you are is not what you did,  
                           You're still an innocent 
  
  
 Time turns flames to embers, 
 You'll have new September's
 Everyone of us has messed up too, ooh
 Lines change like the weather, 
 I hope you remember
 Today is never too late to.. 
           Be brand newww..,  Oohohohoh
  
  
  It's alright, just wait and see your,
                                             String of lights are still bright to me, oh
                                      Who you are is not what you've been,  
                          You're still an innocent
  
                                  It's okay, life is a tough crowd,

                           You're still an innocent 
                           You're still an innocent
  
 Lost your Balance on a tightrope, ohoh
 It's never too late to get it back

 HAUNTED
 Capo 1
 INTRO
  
 VERSE1
 You and I walk a fragile line
 I have known it all this time
 But I never thought I'd live to see it break
 It's getting dark and it's all so quiet and I can't trust anything now
           And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
  
 PRE-CHORUS
 Oh, holding my breath
 Won't lose you again
 Something's made your eyes go cold
  
 CHORUS
 Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
              I thought I had you figured out
                   Something's gone terribly wrong
         You're all I wanted
 Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
              I thought I had you figured out
                    Can't breathe whenever you're gone
        Can't turn back now
  
 I'm haunted
  
 VERSE2
 Stood there and watched you walk away from everything we had
                   But I still mean every word I said to you
 He will try to take away my pain and he just might make me smile
                     But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead
  
 PRE-CHORUS
 Oh, holding my breath
 Won't see you again
 Something keeps me holding onto nothing

 Come on, come on, don't leave me like this

         You're all I wanted
 Come on, come on, don't leave me like this

 LAST KISS
 Capo 3
  
 I still remember the look on your face,
 Lit through the darkness at 1:58,
 The words that you whispered for just us to know.
 You told me you loved me so why did you go 
 Away?
  
   Away.
  
  
 I do recall now the smell of the rain,
 Fresh on the pavement. I ran off the plane.
 That July 9th, the beat of your heart.
     It jumps through your shirt. I can still feel your arms.
  
          But now I'll go sit on the floor,
          Wearing your clothes.
                       All that I know is I don't know.
                          How to be something you miss.
  
                              I never thought we'd have a last kiss.
                      Never imagined we'd end like this.
 Your name forever the name on my lips.
  
 I do remember the swing in your step.
      The life of the party, you're showing off again.
      And I roll my eyes and then you pull me in.
      I'm not much for dancin', but for you I did.
          Because I love your handshake, meetin' my father.
    I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets.
          How you kissed me when I was in the middle of sayin' something.
          There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions.
  
      And I'll go sit on the floor,
          Wearing your clothes.
                       All that I know is I don't know
                          How to be something you miss.
  
                              I never thought we'd have a last kiss.
                      Never imagined we'd end like this.
 Your name forever the name on my lips.
  
        Oo-oo-ooh.
  
     So I'll watch your life in pictures
                           Like I used to watch you sleep
                       And I'll feel you forget me
                          Like I used to feel you breathe
                            And I'll keep up with our old friends
                           Just to ask them how you are.
                           Hope it's nice where you are.
  
        And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
      And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed.
          You can plan for a change in the weather in town,
      but I never planned on you changing your mind.
  
     So I'll go sit on the floor,
          Wearing your clothes.
                       All that I know is I don't know
                          How to be something you miss.
  
                              I never thought we'd have a last kiss.
                      Never imagined we'd end like this.
 Your name forever the name on my lips.
                Just like our last kiss.
                         Forever the name on my lips.
                         Forever the name on my lips.
                Just like our last.

 LONG LIVE
 Intro:                      I say remember this moment In the back of my mind
                              The time we stood with our shaking hands
       The crowds in stands went wild 
                            We were the kings and the queens
                        And they read off our names 
                                The night you danced like you knew our lives
         Would never be the same
                             You held your head like a hero On a history book page
                       It was the end of a decade But the start of an age
  
 Chorus
         Long live the walls we crashed through
                           All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
                          I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
                           And bring on all the pretenders
       One day we will be remembered
  
 Verse 2
                        I said remember this feeling I passed the pictures around
                            Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
             Wishing for right now
                            We are the kings and the queens You traded your baseball cap for a crown
                         When they gave us our trophies And we held them up for our town
                      And the cynics were outraged Screaming, ""this is absurd""
                         'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in 
 ripped up jeans got to rule the world
  
 Chorus
         Long live the walls we crashed through
                           All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
                          I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
                           And bring on all the pretenders I'm not afraid
        Long live all the mountains we moved
                        I had the time of my life
                         Fighting dragons with you
                          I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
                         And bring on all the pretenders
       One day we will be remembered
  
 Bridge
 Hold on to spinning around
      Confetti falls to the ground
            May these memories break our fall
  
 Verse 3
  
                   And you take a moment
              Promise me this:
                            That you'll stand by me forever
          But if God forbid fate should step in
                       And force us into a goodbye
                            If you have children someday
                          When they point to the pictures
                       Please tell them my name
                      Tell them how the crowds went wild
                   Tell them how I hope they shine
  
 Chorus
        Long live the walls we crashed through
                        I had the time of my life with you
             Long,long live the walls we crashed through
                           All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
                          I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
                           And bring on all the pretenders I'm not afraid
        Long live all the mountains we moved
                        I had the time of my life
                         Fighting dragons with you
        long live the look on your face
                         And bring on all the pretenders
       One day we will be remembered

 OURS
 Capo 5
 Intro
  
 Elevator buttons and morning air
 Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
 If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
            But right now, my time is theirs
  
     Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
          They'll judge it like they know about me and you
          And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
             The jury's out, but my choice is you
  
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind
 People throw rocks at things that shine
      And life makes love look hard
                 The stakes are high
              The waters rough
                   But this love is ours
  
      You never know what people have up their sleeves
 Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
 Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
               But I don't care, cause right now you're mine
  
                 And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
 People throw rocks at things that shine
      And life makes love look hard
                 The stakes are high
              The waters rough
                   But this love is ours
  
 And it's not theirs to speculate
          If it's wrong and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong and
 I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
  
 Cause I love the gap between your teeth
 And I love the riddles that you speak
          And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
 Cause my heart is yours
  
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind
 People throw rocks at things that shine
      And life makes love look hard
  
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind
 People throw rocks at things that shine
      But they can't take what's ours
 They can't take what's ours
                 The stakes are high
             The waters rough
                   But this love is ours

 IF THIS WAS A MOVIE
 Capo 2
 Intro
  
 Last night I heard my own heart beating
 Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
 Six months gone and I'm still reaching
 Even though I know you're not there
 I was playing back a thousand memories baby
 Thinkin bout everything we've been through
 Maybe I've been going back too much lately
 When time stood still and I had you
  
  
 Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
 You would, you would, if this was a movie
 Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
 Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
 You could, you could, if you just said ""You're sorry""
 I know that we can work it out somehow
         But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
  
  
 I know people change and these things happen
      But I remember how it was back then
 Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
         'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
          Now I'm pacing down the hall
          Chasing down your street
       Flashback to the night when you said to me
 Nothings gonna change not for me and you
 Not before I knew how much I had to lose
  
  
 Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
 You would, you would, if this was a movie
 Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
 Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
 You could, you could, if you just said ""You're sorry""
 I know that we can work it out somehow
         But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
  
  
   If you're out there if you're 
 Somewhere if you're moving on
 I've be waiting for you 
 Ever since you've been gone
 I just want it back the way it was before
      And I just wanna see you back at my  front door
 (nc)
 And I'd say...
  
  
 Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
 You would, before, you said it's not that easy
 Before the fight before I locked you out
          But I'd take it all back now
  
 Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
 You would, you would, if this was a movie
 Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
 Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
 You could, you could, if you just said ""You're sorry""
 I know that we can work it out somehow
         But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
  
  
 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""A"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">A</span> You'd be here by now
                       It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
       Baby what about the ending, Oh
            I thought you'd be here by noow ohhoohhohhohh
 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""A"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">A</span>  That you'd be here by now

 SUPERMAN
 -Intro-
  
  
 Tall dark and Superman
     He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
              To save the world or go to work
          Its the same thing to me
  
               He's got his mothers eyes his fathers ambition
    I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
            I hang on every word you sa--ay
  
 And, you'll smile and say how are you
 I'll say just fine
              I always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you ... forever!
  
  
 I watch Superman fly away 
               You've got a busy day today
              Go save the world I'll be around
 And I watch Superman fly away
                 Come back I'll be with you someday
                I'll be right here on the ground
 (n. When you come back down
  
  
  
 Talk dark and beautiful
       He's complicated, he's irrational
        But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yea--ah
 Something in his deep browns eyes has me sayin'
       He's not all bad like his reputation and
 I can't hear one single word they saa--ay
  
 And you'll leave got places to be and I'll be o-kay
              I always forget to tell you I love you
    I loved you from the very first day
  
  
  
 I watch Superman fly away

      And I watch Superman fly away
                 Come back I'll be with you someday
                I'll be right here on the ground
                     When you come back down
  
  
 And I watch you fly around the world
                 And I hope you don't take some other girl
                Don't forget! Don't forget! About me!
 I'm far away but I never let you go
                     I'm lovestruck and looking out the window
 Don't forget! Don't forget! Where I'll be!
                         Right here wishing the flowers were from you
              Wishing the card was from you
              Wishing the call was from you
 ( 'Cause I loved you from the very first day
  
  
  
 I watch Superman fly away 
               You've got a busy day today
              Go save the world I'll be around, forever and ever!
 I watch Superman fly away
               I swear I'll be with you someday
                I'll be right here on the ground
                     When you come back down

 Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
 I should be chilling with my folks, I know
 But I’mma be under the mistletoe

 Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
 I should be making a list, I know
 But I’mma be under the mistletoe

 [Intro]
  
 N.C.
 Oh, misty eye of the mountain below 
 N.C.
 Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls 
 N.C.
 And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke 
 N.C.
 Keep watching over Durin's son 
  
  
 [Verse]
  
                     If this is to end in fire                         
                           Then we should all burn together                 
                  Watch the flames climb high into the night              
             Calling out father oh, stand by and we will                   
                  Watch the flames burn auburn on
            The mountain side 
  
                          And if we should die tonight                         
                        Then we should all die together               
             Raise a glass of wine for the last time             
            Calling out father oh
  G               F
 Prepare as we will 
                   Watch the flames burn over and over        
         The mountain side 
       Desolation comes upon the sky

                  Now I see fire

                        Confined in mountain holes 
             We got too close to the flame
             Calling out father oh
  G               F
 Hold fast and we will
                    Watch the flames burn auburn on
         The mountain side 
           Desolation comes upon the sky

                    And if the night is burning         
            I will cover my eyes                 
                For if the dark returns then      
   My brothers will die 
                      And as the sky's falling down 
           It crashed into this lonely town
                      And with that shadow upon the ground
                     I hear my people screaming out

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 So called Mr Rock And Roll is dancing on his own again
 Talking on his phone again to someone who tells him
            That his balance is low, he's got no where to go, he's on his own again
  
 Rock chick of the century is acting like she used to be
 Dancing like there's no one there before she never seemed to care
        Now she wouldn't dare, it's so rock and roll to be alone
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And they'll meet one day far away and say, I wish I was something more
 And they'll meet one day far away and say, I wish I knew you
 I wish I knew you before
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Mrs Black and White she's never seen a shade of grey
 Always something on her mind every single day
                 But now she's lost her way and where does she go from here
  
 Mr Multicultural sees all that one can see
 He's living proof of someone very different to me
               But now he wants to be free free so he can see
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And they'll meet one day far away and say, I wish I was something more
 And they'll meet one day far away and say, I wish I knew you
 I wish I knew you before
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
            He'll say, I wish I knew you, I wish I met you when time was still on my side
            She'll say, I wish I knew you, I wish I loved you before I was his bride
  
 And so they must depart too many more are broken hearts
 But I've seen that all before in TV, books and film and more
                 And there's a happy ending every single day
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And they'll meet one day far away and say, I wish I was something more
 And they'll meet one day far away and say, I wish I knew you

 2. This Is the Life
  
  
 Note: Amy normally plays the 4 chords this way without a capo
  
 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""A"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">A</span> <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""G#m"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">G#m</span>  
 but using a capo is so much easier.
  
  
 A good arrangement with two guitars would be with one playing the non-capo version
 and the other playing the capo version and the riff whenever it comes up
  
  
 Riffs:

         Oh the wind whistles down the cold dark street tonight
           And the people they were dancing to the music vibe
          And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair
             While the shocked too many just sit way over there
           And the songs they get louder each one better than before

 So you’re heading down the road in your taxi for four
 And you’re waiting outside Jimmy’s front door
 But nobody’s in and nobody’s home till four
 So you’re sitting there with nothing to do
 Talking about Robert Ragger and his motley crew
 And where you gonna go, and where you gonna sleep tonight?

 And you're singing the songs thinking this is the life
 And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size

 A poetic genius it's something I don't see
 Why would a genius be tripping on me?
            And he's looking at me now but what he can't see
              Is that I'm looking through his eyes so many lies behind his eyes
               And tell me stories from your past and sing me songs you wrote before
               I tell you this my poison prince, you'll soon be knockin' on heavens door

                Some kind of poison prince with your eyes in a daze

       Is an upbeat song so we can dance the night away

 You've given up, you've given in, another sucker of that slime

 Some kind of poison prince with your eyes in a daze
 Some kind of poison prince your life is like a maze
 And what we all want and what we all crave

 And maybe if you had a true point of view I would listen to you
 But it's just your one sided feelings they keep getting in my way

 [Verse 1]
  
 Put a ribbon round my neck and call me a libertine
 I will sing you songs of dreams I used to dream
 I will sail away on seas of silver and gold
 Until I reach my home
 Give me a guitar and I'll be your troubadour
 Your strolling minstrel 12th century door to door
           I don't know anymore if that feeling is past
           Will it last, oh how can you be sure?
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
    And how do I know if you're feeling the same as me?
    And how do I know that that's the only place you want to be?
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Give me a stage and I'll be your rock and roll queen
 Your 20th century cover of a magazine
            Rolling Stone here I come, watch out everyone
            I'm singing, I'm singing my song
 Give me a festival and I'll be your Glastonbury star
 The lights are shining everyone knows who you are
           Singing songs about dreams about hopes about schemes
 Ooooh they just came true
  
  
 [Chorus] (x2)
  
    And how do I know if you're feeling the same as me?
    And how do I know if that's the only place you want to be?

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
          Oh the sun is shining far too bright for it to still be night
          Oh the air feels so cold, so cold and old, how can it be light
           Oh let's take a walk outside, see the world through each other's eyes
     I wish I was your only one
 I think you're beautiful but your hair is a mess and your shoes are untied
                  But that's what I love best
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
       And I, I wish I was the one, you lonely lonely son, and you looked at me that way
              I wish for long lingering glances, fairytale romances every single day
           And you look at me and say I'm your best friend every day
         But I wish for something, wish for something more
         Oh, I love you like a friend but let's not pretend
         How I wish for something, wish for something more
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
 (repeat this pattern over the verse)
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Now the grass is so green, but I can't see anything, past your eyes
 I'm fixated on your smile, your cherry lips make life worthwhile
 I'm thinking these things what I'm trying to say is
 This life gets in my way every single day
  
 (repeat this pattern over the chorus)
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And I, I wish I was the one, you lonely lonely son, and you looked at me that way
 I wish for long lingering glances, fairytale romances every single day
 And you look at me and say I'm your best friend every day
 But I wish for something, wish for something more
 Oh, I love you like a friend but let's not pretend
 How I wish for something, wish for something more
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
          Now the sun is fading, now the rain is coming down
           And I'm looking at your face when you're looking at the ground
          I see diamonds in your dreams I see pearls around your neck
         I see everything that's beautiful, everything that's beautiful
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 I wish I was the one, you lonely lonely son, and you looked at me that way
 I wish for long lingering glances, fairytale romances every single day
 And you look at me and say I'm your best friend every day
 But I wish for something, wish for something more
 Oh, I love you like a friend but let's not pretend
 How I wish for something, wish for something more

   Oh Mr James Dean, he don't belong to anything
          Oh he left before they could get him with their ways, their wicked ways
  
   Oh Marilyn Monroe, where did you go
                           I didn't hear all your stories, I didn't see all your glories
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
           But the footballer's wife tells her troubles and strife
                I just don't care in the end, who is she to pretend
              That she's one of them, I don't think so
           And the girl from that show, yes the one we all know

 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""Em"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Em</span> Oh Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire
 won't you dance for me cause I just don't care
 What's going on today, I think there's something more, something more
  
 And I'm gone with the wind like they were before
 But I'm believing myself I think there's something more
 There must be something more, I think there's something more, something more
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 But still the footballer's wife tells her troubles and strife
 I just don't care in the end, who is she to pretend
 That she's one of them, I don't think so
 And the girl from that show, yes the one we all know
 She thinks she's some kind of star, yes you know who you are
 I don't think so, I don't think so
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 Oh I don't believe in the telling of your stories
 Throughout your life, there's just something unappealing
 It don't catch my eye, it don't catch my eye
  
 Oh I don't believe in the selling of your glories
 Before you leave this life, there's so much more to see
 I don't believe this is how the world should be
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 But still the footballer's wife tells her troubles and strife
 I just don't care in the end, who is she to pretend
 That she's one of them, I don't think so
 And the girl from that show, yes the one we all know
 She thinks she's some kind of star, yes you know who you are
 I don't think so, I don't think so
  
  
 [Outro]
  
 The footballer's wife tells her troubles and strife
 I just don't care in the end, who is she to pretend
 That she's one of them?

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 I don't know if you can see the changes that have come over me
         In these last few days I've been afraid that I might drift away
              So I've been telling old stories and singing songs
         That make me think about where I came from
     And that's the reason why I feel so far away today
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
       And let me tell you that I love you, that I think about you all the time
 Caledonia's been calling me and now I'm going home
      And if I should become a stranger you know that it would make me more than sad
 Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
 Caledonia's been everything I've ever had

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 I can't win, I can't reign
 I will never win this game
 Without you, without you
  
 I am lost, I am vain,
 I will never be the same
 Without you, without you
  
 I won't run, I won't fly
 I will never make it by
 Without you, without you
  
 I can't rest, I can't fight
 All I need is you and I,
 Without you, without.... You!

 You you you
 Without
 You you you
 Without you..

 Can't erase, so I'll take blame
 But I can't accept that
 we're estranged
 Without you, without you
  
 I can't quit now, this can't be right
 I can't take one more sleep this night
 Without you, without you
  
 I won't soar, I won't climb
 If you're not here I'm paralyzed
 without you, without you
  
 I can't look, I'm so blind
 Lost my heart, I lost my mind
 without you without... You!

 Oh oh oh
 You you you

 One thing I ask of you
 Let me be the one you back that ass to
 Yo, from Malibu, to Paribu
 Yeah, had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
 So hit me up when you passing through
 I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
 Swag on, even when you dress casual
 I mean it's not almost unbearable
 Then, honey you're not there when I'm
 With my foresight bitch you pay me by
 Nothing like your last guy, he too square for you
 He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that
 So I just watch and wait for you to salute
 But you didn't pick
 Not many women can refuse this pimpin'
 But I'm a nice guy, but you get it if you get with me

               I've always been the kind of girl 
        That hid my face 
       So afraid to tell the world 
   What I've got to say 
         But I have this dream 
    Bright inside of me 
            I'm gonna let it show

      To let you know

 This is essentially the same tab submitted earlier so I can't take any credit. It is,
 however, tabbed for putting a capo on the second fret.  This makes it sound better
 since you don't have to use a bar chord.  It's easier as well.  Enjoy!
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 They made up their minds
                    And they started packing
         They left before the sun came up that day
         An exit to eternal summer slacking
 But where were they going without ever
                  Knowing the way?
  
 They drank up the wine
                  And they got to talking
 They now had more important things to say
 When the car broke down they started walking
 Where were they going without even
                  Knowing the way?
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Anyone can see the road that they walk on
           Is paved with gold
 It's always summer
                They'll never get cold
                They'll never get hungry
                They'll never get old and grey
                     You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
           They won't make it home
           But they really don't care
           They wanted the highway
                They're happier there today
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Their children woke up
                      And they couldn't find them
          They left before the sun came up that day
          They just drove off and left it all behind'em
 But where were they going without ever

    And I can't help but ask myself
                      how much I'll let the fear take the wheel and steer

    It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague,
        haunting mass appeal
    But lately I'm beginning to find that I
                      should be the one behind the wheel.

    will I choose water over wine and hold my own and drive?
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
    It's driven me before and it seems to be the way
                  that everyone else gets around
    But lately I'm beginning to find that when
                  I drive myself my light is found
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
    Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
                  with open arms and open eyes, yeah

                 A heart on the run, keeps a hand on the gun, it can’t trust anyone
           I was so sure, what I needed was more, tried to shoot out the sun
                  In days when we raged, we flew off the page, such damage was done
                But I made it through, ‘cause somebody knew, I was meant for someone

     So girl leave your boots by the bed we ain’t leavin’ this room
       'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolia’s bloom

            I sobered up, and I swore off that stuff, forever this time
                     And the old lovers sing ""I thought it’d be me who helped him get home""
                 But home was a dream, one I’d never seen, ‘til you came along
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
  
     So girl hang your dress up to dry, we ain’t leavin’ this room
           'Til the Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through*

 [Verse 1]
  
         Life's like a road that you travel on
          There's one day here and the next day gone
      Sometimes you bend; sometimes you stand; sometimes you turn your back to the wind
            There's a world outside every darkened door
        Where blues won't haunt you anymore
            Where the brave are free and lovers soar, come ride with me to the distant shore
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
   We won't hesitate to break down the garden gate
 There's not much time left today

 Life is a highway, I wanna ride it all night long
 If you're going my way, I wanna drive it all night long
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
          Through all these cities, and all these towns
       It's in my blood and in it's all around
    I love you now, like I loved you then;
  
 This is the road, and these are the hands
       From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
      The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's Lights
 Knock me down and back up again
  
 You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
   There's no load I can't hold, a road so rough, this I know
 I'll be there when the light comes in
       Just tell 'em we're survivors
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Life is a highway, I wanna ride it all night long
 If you're going my way, I wanna drive it all night long
  
 Life is a highway, I wanna ride it all night long
 If you're going my way, I wanna drive it all night long

 [Verse 1]
    I came to you and never asked too much
   Wondering what you would say
 Hoping you'd understand
               It's not a role I usually play
            Don't speak too much of what's been going on
         The past is over and gone
        Give me your troubled mind

          I can do so much for you , I want you

 You're brave to say that you get lost in love
             But you opened your heart to me
   Underneath all you feel you know
         How deep our love could be
      Tonight we'll touch until it's time to go
              Then I'm leaving it up to you
 Even a fool would know that I'm not through
          I can do so much for you I want you

   Just a shot in the dark that you just might

 [Verse 1]
  
   It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
   I'm not one of those who can easily hide
   I don't have much money but, boy if I did
   I'd buy a big house where, we both could live
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
   If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
           Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
   I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
   My gift is my song and, this one's for you
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And you can tell everybody, this is your song
 It may be quite simple but, now that it's done
 I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind,
 that I put down in words
      How wonderful life is, while you're in the world
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
   I sat on the roof, and kicked off the moss
   Well a few of the verses well, they've got me quite cross
   But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
   It's for people like you, that keep it turned on
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
   So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
   You see I've forgotten if they're, green or they're blue
   Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
   Yours are the sweetest eyes, I've ever seen

 And you can tell everybody, this is your song
 It may be quite simple but, now that it's done

                 And you're the perfect thing to say
  
            And you play it coy, but it's kinda cute
               Ah, When you smile at me you know exactly what you do
             Baby don't pretend, that you don't know it's true
                Cause you can see it when I look at you

 [Verse 1]
   Oh, my life is changing every day
                 Every possible way
   And oh, my dreams, it's never quite as it seems
                    Never quite as it seems
  
   I know I felt like this before
                              But now I'm feeling it even more
                       Because it came from you
  
   Then I open up and see
                              The person falling here is me
                     A different way to be

                   Impossible to ignore
   They'll come true, impossible not to do
                    Impossible not to do
  
   Now I tell you openly
                                  You have my heart so don't hurt me
                      For what I couldn't find

 Notes:
 - The E7/G# chord is THAT chord from the bridge in Don't Look Back In Anger. If it
 weird to you then just play the standard E7 = 020100 and it will sound close enough
 - 5.12.06: updated to correct guitar chord names, C to C/G and Cmaj/G# to E7/G#

 Capo III *
  
  
 Just about a year ago, I set out on the road,
                     Seekin my fame and fortune, lookin for a pot of gold.
 Things got bad, and things got worse, I guess you will know the tune.
             Oh ! lord, stuck in Lodi again.
  
 Rode in on the Greyhound, I’ll be walkin out if I go.
                    I was just passin through, must be seven months or more.
 Ran out of time and money, looks like they took my friends.
                 Oh ! lord, I’m stuck in Lodi again.
  
  
 The man from the magazine said I was on my way.
                     Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play.
 I came into town, a one night stand, looks like my plans fell through
             Oh ! lord, stuck in Lodi again.
  
  
 Mmmm...
  
 If I only had a dollar, for every song I’ve sung.
                      And every time I’ve had to play while people sat there drunk.
      You know, I'd catch the next train back to where I live.
                 Oh ! lord, I’m stuck in Lodi again.
                 Oh ! lord, I’m stuck in Lodi again.

  On the acoustic version, that's up on youtube, I think it's played half-step
  down or something like that. I think there's a couple extra chords that are
  missing too but, I can't figure them out.

 You can also play the song, if you tune your guitar down a half-step to Eb.

 [Verse 1]
  
                You know you love me, I know you care
               Just shout whenever, and I’ll be there
            You want my love, you want my heart
            And we will never, ever, ever be apart
             Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
            We're just friends, what are you saying?
               Say there’s another and look right in my eyes
         My first love broke my heart for the first time

                  And I'm was like, baby, baby, baby no

     For you, I would have done whatever
            And I just can’t believe we ain’t together
            And I'm gotta play it cool, ‘cause I'm losing you
             I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
           ‘Cause I'm in pieces, baby fix me
        Just shake ‘til you wake me from this bad dream
        I'm goin’ down, down, down
 And I just can’t believe my first love won’t be around

      I thought you'd always be mine, mine

 Capo II or as desired; this is written to be easy to play on the guitar. I read somewhere
 that Miss Hepburn sang it in F, but I don't know if that is correct. Not in the original key,
 which is much higher.
 The vertical lines indicate bars.

          Oh life    is bigger,    it's bigger than you.
              And you are not me, the lengths that I will go to.
                             The distance in your eyes.
    Oh no, I've said     too    much, I've said enough.
  
  
 #Guitar pass#
  
                           That's me in the corner,    That's me in the spot light,

                     Every whisper,
               Every waking hour, I'm choosing my confessions.
            Trying to keep eye on you.
         Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool.
    Oh no, I've said too much.    I said enough.

                 Consider this,    consider this hint of the century.
                 Consider this,    the slip, that brought me to my knees pale.
 What if all these fantasies come    flaming aground.
           Now I've said too much.

 [Verse 1]
 While I'm on Sunset, are you on the subway?
 While I drive, are you gettin' on the L-train?
                     I mean, Manhattan's nice, but so are Malibu nights
 You would know if you stayed, you would know if you put up a fight
 Your toes turn blue in winter, I'm gettin' red, rum
 Does the trick for all of the things left unsaid, I'm
 Missin' our drunken 2 A.M. strolls in K-Town
 Now you're chasing fake highs in the Upper West Side
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus 1]
 Fuckin' on Brooklyns in Brooklyn, your Chelseas in Chelsea
 Hope that eases the pain, so you remember to miss me
 And you sold your car, now you walk for miles
 Bet your feet feel numb
                                                          (Crosswalks in my mind are shaky, so please hold on tight)

 All my demons run wild
                All my demons have your smile
                       In the city of angels, in the city of angels
 Hope New York holds you
                    Hope it holds you like I do
                               While my demons stay faithful

 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""Gmaj7"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Gmaj7</span> Remember last winter when we would drive around?
 Silverlake, Hollywood, pretty little white lies got me good
 Thought this was love, I was misunderstood, mmm
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus 2]
 Feelin' low on the low, drivin' through NoHo
 If I'm honest, I'd call, but I'm trying to let go
 And I hope you're happy, livin' life in taxis
 But you'll always have me, you'll always have me

 All my demons run wild
                All my demons have your smile
                       In the city of angels, in the city of angels
 Hope New York holds you
                    Hope it holds you like I do
                               While my demons stay faithful
                  In the city of angels
       Mmmmmmm
 While my demons stay faithful
                    In the city of angels

 [Verse]
  
 We can remember swimming in December,
 Heading for the city lights, in 1975
 We share in each other
 Nearer than father
 The scent of a lemon, drips from your eyes
  
 We are the people that rule the world
 A force running in every boy and girl
 All rejoicing in the world
 Take me now
 We can try
  
 We lived an adventure
 Love in the Summer
 Followed the sun till night
 Reminiscing other times of life
 For each every other
 The feeling was stronger
 The shock hit eleven
 Got lost in your eyes
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
    I can’t do well when I think you’re gonna leave me, but I know I try
                Are you gonna leave me now
 Can’t you be believing now

 [Verse]
  
 Can you remember and humanize,
 It was still where we’d energized,
 Lie in the sand and visualize like its 75 again
  
 We are the people that rule the world
 A force running in every boy and girl
 All rejoicing in the world
 Take me now
 We can try
  
  
 [Chorus]

   You sheltered me from harm,   kept me warm,   kept me warm
   You gave my life to me,   set me free,    set me free
   The finest years I ever knew,           were all the years I had with you

 Nobody else could ever know,          the part of me that can't let go

 I am just a poor boy
                           Though my story's seldom told
         I have squandered my resistance
        For a pocket full of mumbles such are promises
               All lies and jests
          Still a man hears what he wants to hear
                     And disregards the rest
  
         When I left my home and my family
        I was no more than a boy
         In the company of strangers
         In the quiet of the railway station running scared
         Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
                          Where the ragged people go
           Looking for the places only they would know

       I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
                      I took some comfort there
  
           Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
      And wishing I was gone
        Going home
            Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
 Bleeding me, going home

 [Verse]
  
 On the other side of a street I knew, stood a girl that looked like you 
 I guess that's deja vu but I thought this can't be true cause 
 You moved to west L.A or New York or Santa Fe or 
 Wherever to get away from me
  
 Oh but that one night was more than just right
 I didn't leave you cause I was all through 
 Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell 
 Because I really fell for you
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Oh I swear to you I'll be there for you this is not a drive by-i-i-i-i
 Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply Hefty bag to hold my i-i-i-i- love 
 When you move me everything is groovy they don't like it sue me 
 umm the way you do me 
 Oh I swear to you I'll be there for you this is not a drive by-i-i-i-i
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 On the other side of a downward spiral, my love for you went viral 
 And I loved you every mile you drove away 
 But now here you are again so let's skip the ""how you been"" and 
 Get down to the ""more than friends"" at last
  
 Oh but that one night is still the highlight 
 I didn't leave you until I came to
 And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell 
 Because I really fell for you
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Oh I swear to you I'll be there for you this is not a drive by-i-i-i-i

          There's nothing up my sleeve

 I don’t know what I want, so don’t ask me
            Cause I’m still trying to figure it out

      Who feels the way I do

          I’ll be strong, I’ll be wrong, oh but life goes on

                  Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
            Could you tell me what more do I need
      And tomorrow’s just a mystery, oh yeah

  In a few weeks I will get time
  To realise it's right before my eyes
  And I can take it if it's

  To think about the questions to address

            You were cold as the blood through your bones

     Well I was lost
  
             And now I sleep
             Sleep the hours and that I can't weep

                Just give me time

           Wrap my flesh in ivory and in twine

 [Verse 1]
  
    I'm in love with the world
                Through the eyes of a girl
                 Who's still around the morning after
  
    We broke up a month ago
          I grew up I didn't know
            I'd be around the morning after

 it's always been wait and see
            a happy day and then you pay
                  and feel like shit the morning after
  
  
 but now I feel changed around
           and instead falling down
                I'm standing up the morning after

                But turned around sooner or laaaaa...    ter...

 I could be another fool
        an exception to the rule
            you tell me the morning after
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
   Crooked spin can't come to rest
      I'm damaged bad at best
            She'll decide what she wants
  
   I'll probably be the last to know
         No one says until it shows
              And you see how it iiiiiiiis...

  [Intro]
  
    
  
  [Verse]
  
     Walking through a crowd the village is aglow
       Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
    Everybody here wanted something more
     Searching for a sound we hadn’t heard before, and it said
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
     Welcome to New York, it’s been waiting for you
     Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
     Welcome to New York, it’s been waiting for you
     Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
  It’s a new soundtrack
                           I could dance to this beat forever more
                        The lights are so bright
                          But they never blind me, me
     Welcome to New York, it’s been waiting for you
     Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
  
  
  [Verse]
  
          When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
      Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
    Everybody here was someone else before
                 And you can want who you want
     Boys and boys and girls and girls
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
     Welcome to New York, it’s been waiting for you
     Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
     Welcome to New York, it’s been waiting for you
     Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
  It’s a new soundtrack
                           I could dance to this beat forever more
                        The lights are so bright
                          But they never blind me, me
     Welcome to New York, it’s been waiting for you
     Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
  
  
  [Bridge]
  
  Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
  Like any real love, it’s ever changing
  Like any true love, it drives you crazy
  But you know you wouldn’t change anything, anything, anything
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
     Welcome to New York, it’s been waiting for you
     Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
     Welcome to New York, it’s been waiting for you
     Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
  It’s a new soundtrack
                           I could dance to this beat 
          The lights are so bright
                          But they never blind me
     Welcome to New York, it’s been waiting for you
     Welcome to New York, the lights are so bright but they never blind me
     Welcome to New York, so bright they never blind me
     Welcome to New York, Welcome to New York

  Nice to meet you
  
  Where you been?
                                  I could show you incredible things
  
  Magic, madness, heaven, sin
                                Saw you there and I thought oh my god
  
  Look at that face, you look like my next mistake
     Love's a game, want to play?
  New money, suit and tie
                               I can read you like a magazine
  
  Ain't it funny, rumors fly
                               And I know you heard about me
  
  So hey, let's be friends
  
  I'm dying to see how this one ends
      Grab your passport and my hand
  
  I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
  So it's gonna be forever
  
  Or it's gonna go down in flames
  You can tell me when it's over
  
  If the high was worth the pain
  Got a long list of ex lovers
  
  They'll tell you I'm insane
  Cause you know I love the players
  
  And you love the game
  Cause we're young and we're reckless
  
  We'll take this way too far
  It'll leave you breathless 
  
  Or with a nasty scar
  Got a long list of ex lovers
  
  They'll tell you I'm insane
  But I got a blank space baby
                         And I'll write your name
  
  
  [Verse]
  
  Cherry lips
  
  Crystal skies
                                  I could show you incredible things
  
  Stolen kisses, pretty lies
                                      You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
  
  Find out what you want
  
  Be that girl for a month
      Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
  Screaming, crying, perfect storms
                               I can make all the tables turn
  
  Rose garden filled with thorns
                                  Keep you second guessing like oh my god
  
  Who is she? I get drunk on jealousy
         But you'll come back each time you leave
  
  Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
  So it's gonna be forever
  
  Or it's gonna go down in flames
  You can tell me when it's over
  
  If the high was worth the pain
  Got a long list of ex lovers
  
  They'll tell you I'm insane
  Cause you know I love the players

                         And I'll write your name
  
  
  [Bridge]
  
     Boys only want love if it's torture
  Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn you
  Boys only want love if it's torture
    Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn you

     Looking at it now

         I remember

             Then discovered 
                    The rest of the world was black and white
                      But we were in screaming color and I remember thinking
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
  Are we out of the woods yet, are we out of the woods yet, 
                                                     are we out of the woods yet, are we out of the woods
  
  Are we in the clear yet, are we in the clear yet, are we in the clear yet ?
                        In the clear yet ? Good
  
  Are we out of the woods yet, are we out of the woods yet,
                                                     are we out of the woods yet, are we out of the woods
  
  Are we in the clear yet, are we in the clear yet, are we in the clear yet ?
                        In the clear yet ? Good
  
  
  [Verse]
  
     Looking at it now
             Last December 
             We were built to fall apart
                      Then fall back together 
                   Your necklace hanging from my neck
                                                  The night we couldn't quite forget, when we decided, we decided
                To move the furniture so we could dance, baby like we stood a chance
               Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying and I remember thinking
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
  Are we out of the woods yet, are we out of the woods yet, 
                                                     are we out of the woods yet, are we out of the woods
  
  Are we in the clear yet, are we in the clear yet, are we in the clear yet ?
                        In the clear yet ? Good
  
  Are we out of the woods yet, are we out of the woods yet,
                                                     are we out of the woods yet, are we out of the woods
  
  Are we in the clear yet, are we in the clear yet, are we in the clear yet ?
                        In the clear yet ? Good

  Remember when you hit the brakes too soon, 20 stitches in a hospital room
                                                                                        When you started crying, baby I did too, but when the sun came up, I was looking at you
                                                                                    Remember when we couldn't take the heat, I walked out, I said I'm setting you free
                                                                                             But the monsters turned out to be just trees, when the sun came up, you were looking at me
                         You were looking at me, you were looking at me
          I remember, oh I remember

                                                     are we out of the woods yet, are we out of the woods

    Are we out of the woods yet, are we out of the woods yet, 
                                                     are we out of the woods yet, are we out of the woods
  
  Are we in the clear yet, are we in the clear yet, are we in the clear yet ?
                        In the clear yet ? Good
  
  Are we out of the woods yet, are we out of the woods yet,
                                                     are we out of the woods yet, are we out of the woods
  
  Are we in the clear yet, are we in the clear yet, are we in the clear yet ?

  People like you always want back the love they gave away
                              People like me want to believe you when you say you've changed
  The more I think about it now
                 The less I know
                            All I know is that you drove us off the road
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
      Stay, Hey, all you had to do was stay
                                 Had me in the palm of your hand
                                    Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
      Stay, hey, now you say you want it
                                 Back now that it's just too late

                          I've been picking up pieces of the mess you made
  People like you always want back the love they pushed aside

               Not like this
  Not like this
  
  Oh, all you had to do was

  [Intro]
  
     
  
  [Verse]
  
  It's 2 am, in your car
  Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
  You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
    You're thinking that I hate you now 'cause you still don't know what I never said
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
  I wish you would come back
  
  Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
     I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live and I
  Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good, I wish you would
  
  
  [Verse]
  
  It's 2 am, in my room

  2am here we are
  See your face, hear my voice in the dark
  We're a crooked love in a straight line down
  Makes you wanna run and hide but it made us turn right back around
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
  I wish you would come back
  
  Wish I never hung up the phone like I did

     I wish you know that I'll never forget you as long as I live and I
  Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good, I wish you would
  I wish we could go back

     Now we got problems
                  And I don't think we can solve them
                 You made a really deep cut
              And baby now we got bad blood, hey!
  
  
  [Verse]
  
     Did you have to do this?
    I was thinking that you could be trusted
     Did you have to ruin what was shiny now it's all rusted
     Did you have to hit me where I'm weak baby I couldn't breathe
         And rub it in so deep
     Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

  [Verse]
  
     Did you think we'd be fine?
      Still got scars on my back from your knife
        So don't think it's in the past
      These kinds of wounds they last and they last
         Now did you think it all through?
    All these things will catch up to you
         And time can heal but this won't

  [Bridge]
  
     Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
     You say sorry just for show
            If you live like that, you live with ghosts
     Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
      You say sorry just to show
            If you live like that, you live with ghosts
  
  If you love like that blood runs cold
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
                Cause baby now we got bad blood
                You know it used to be mad love

                Cause baby now we got bad blood, hey!
     Now we got problems

  [Verse]
  
             He said let's get out of this town
                      Drive out of the city, away from the crowds
               I thought heaven can't help me now
                     Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
                      He's so tall, and handsome as hell
  He's so bad but does it so well
    I can see the end as it begins my one condition is
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
     Say you'll remember me
                   Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe

           I say no one has to know what we do
                         His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
              And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
                              But this is getting good now
                       He's so tall, and handsome as hell
  He's so bad but does it so well
  When we've had our very last kiss
        My last request is

     Someday when you leave me
    I bet these memories follow you around
         You see me in hindsight
     Tangled up with you all night
     Burning it down
     Some day when you leave me
    I bet these memories follow you around

     Say you'll remember me
                   Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
     Red lips and rosy cheeks
                      Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your

  [Verse]
  
  Stand there like a ghost
                       Shaking from the rain, rain
  She'll open up the door
                       And say are you insane
  Say it's been a long 6 months
  And you were too afraid
                          To tell her what you want
                       And that's how it works

  [Verse]
  
  Remind her how it used to be
  With pictures in frames 
                   Of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
  Tell her how you must have lost your mind
  When you left her all alone 
                         And never told her why
                   That's how it works

    I don't want you to go
  Remind me how it used to be
  Pictures in frames, kisses on cheeks, and say you want me 
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
    I want you for worse or for better
    I would wait forever and ever
      Broke your heart
          I'll put it back together
    I would wait forever and ever
  And that's how it works

  And that's how it works
                            That's how you get the girl, girl
  And that's how it works

  [Verse]
  
       Clear blue water
                                     High tide, came and brought you in, and I could go, on and on, on and on

  And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

     Tossing, turning, struggled through the night for someone new

     Lantern, burning, flickered in the mind only for you
  
  But you were still gone, gone, gone
  
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  
             Through losing grip, on sinking ships
          You showed up just in time

          This love is good, this love is bad
          This love is alive back from the dead, oh
  These hands had to let it go free
       And this love came back to me
  This love left a permanent mark
          This love is glowing in the dark
  These hands had to let it go free
       And this love came back to me
  
  
  [Bridge]
  
  Your kiss, my cheek
  I watched you leave
  Your smile, my ghost
  I fell to my knees
  When you're young, you just run but you
  Come back to what you neeeeeeeeeeed
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
          This love is good, this love is bad
          This love is alive back from the dead
  These hands had to let it go free
       And this love came back to me
  This love left a permanent mark
          This love is glowing in dark
  These hands had to let it go free
       And this love came back to me

  You stand with your hand on my waistline

                      I can hear them whisper as we pass by
                   It's a bad sign, bad sign
  Something happens when everybody finds out
                      See the vultures circling , dark clouds

     Baby  
  I know places we won't be found and
       They'll be

  Loose lips sink ships all the damn time 
              Not this time

  [Verse]
  
  The drought was the very worst
  When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
  It was months, and months of back and forth
  You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
  
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  
     Hung my head, as I lost the war, and sky turned to black like a perfect storm
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
     Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
      That's when I could finally breathe
            And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
  
  
  [Verse]
  
  There was nothing left to do
  When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
  So I punched a hole in the roof
  I let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
  
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  
         The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
     Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
      That's when I could finally breathe
            And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
    I think I am finally clean
  Said I think I am finally clean
  
  
  [Bridge]
  
     10 months sober, I must admit
     Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
     10 months older I won't give in
     Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it
  The drought was the very worst
  When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
     Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
      That's when I could finally breathe
            And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
     Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
      That's when I could finally breathe
            And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
  Finally clean
                        Think I'm finally clean
  Think I'm finally clean

  [Verse]
  
      Flashing lights and we took a wrong turn and we
     Fell down a rabbit hole
         You held on tight to me 'cause nothing's as it seems
     Spinning out of control
  
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  
     Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
     Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
     Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds
     Didn't it all seem new and exciting
    I felt your arms twisting around me
    I should've slept with one eye open at night
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
     We found wonderland
     You and I got lost in it
         And we pretended it could last forever
     We found wonderland
     You and I got lost in it
         And life was never worse but never better
                In wonderland 
                In wonderland

                In wonderland
  
  
  [Verse]
  
        So we went on our way, too in love to think straight
    All alone or so it seemed
                      But there were strangers watching, whispers turned to talking
        And talking turned to screams
  
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  
     Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
     Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
     Didn't you call my fears with a Cheshire cat smile
     Didn't it all seem new and exciting
    I felt your arms twisting around me
          It's all fun a game, 'til somebody loses their mind
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
     We found wonderland
     You and I got lost in it
         And we pretended it could last forever
     We found wonderland
     You and I got lost in it
         And life was never worse but never better
                In wonderland 
                In wonderland 
                In wonderland 
                In wonderland
  
  
  [Bridge]
  
       I reached for you
        But you were gone
        I knew I had to go back home
         You searched the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
        And in the end in wonderland we both went mad
  
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
     We found wonderland
     You and I got lost in it
         And we pretended it could last forever
     We found wonderland
     You and I got lost in it
         And life was never worse but never better
     We found wonderland
     You and I got lost in it
         And we pretended it could last forever
     We found wonderland
     You and I got lost in it
         And life was never worse but never better

  [Verse]
  
  One look, dark room
  
  Meant just for you
  Time moved too fast
  
  You play it back
  Buttons on a coat
  
  Lighthearted joke
  No proof not much
  
  But you saw enough
  Small talk, he drives
  
  Coffee at midnight
  The light reflects
  
  The chain on your neck
  He says look up
  
  And your shoulders brush
  No proof, one touch
  
  But you felt enough
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
  You can hear it in the silence, silence
  You can feel it on the way home, way home
  You could see it with the lights out, lights out
                You are in love, true love
                You are in love
  
  
  [Verse]
  
  Morning, his place
  
  Burnt toast, sunday
  You keep his shirt
  
  He keeps his word
  And for once you let go
  
  Of your fears, your ghosts
  One step, not much, but it said enough
  You kiss on sidewalks
  
  You fight then you talk
  One night he wakes, strange look, his face
  Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
  You knew what it was, he is in love
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
  You can hear it in the silence, silence
  You can feel it on the way home, way home
  You can see it with the lights out, lights out
                You are in love, true love
           So it goes
  
  
  [Bridge]
  
  You two are dancing in a snow globe, round and round
  He keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
  And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
  And why I spent my whole life try to put it into words
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
  'Cause you can hear it in the silence
  You can feel it on the way home
  You could see it with the lights out
                You are in love, true love
                You are in love
  You can hear it in the silence, silence
  You can feel it on the way home, way home
  You could see it with the lights out, lights out
                You are in love, true love
                You are in love
  You can hear it in the silence, silence
  You can feel it on the way home, way home
  You could see it with the lights out, lights out
                You are in love, true love
                You are in love

  [Intro]
  
    
          We're all bored
          We're all so tired of everything
        We wait for trains that just aren't coming
         We show off our different scarlet letters
      Trust me mine is better
           We're so young that we're on the road to ruin
         We play dumb
                 But we know exactly what we're doin'
         We cry tears
          Of mascara in the bathroom
           Honey life is just a classroom
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
  Cause baby I could build a castle
           Out of all the bricks they threw at me
                And every day it's like battle
               But every night with us is like a dream
                                 Baby we're the new romantics
                                   Come on, come on along with me
                                      Heartbreak is the national anthem
                       We sing it proudly
                            We are too busy dancing
                                To get knocked off our feet
                                  Baby we're the new romantics
                          The best people in life are free
  
  
  [Verse]
  
          We're all here
         The lights and noise are blinding
        We hang back
     It's all in the timing
          It's poker, he can't see it in my face
               But I'm about to play my ace
        We need love, but all we want is danger
        We team up then switch sides like a record changer
         The rumors are terrible and cruel
               Buy honey most of them are true
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
  Cause baby I could build a castle
           Out of all the bricks they threw at me
                And every day it's like battle
               But every night with us is like a dream
                                 Baby we're the new romantics
                                   Come on, come on along with me
                                      Heartbreak is the national anthem
                       We sing it proudly
                            We are too busy dancing
                                To get knocked off our feet
                                  Baby we're the new romantics
                          The best people in life are free
  
  
  [Bridge]
  
  Please take my hand
       And please take me dancing
  Please leave me stranded, it's so romantic
  
  
  [Chorus]
  
  Cause baby I could build a castle
           Out of all the bricks they threw at me
                And every day it's like battle
