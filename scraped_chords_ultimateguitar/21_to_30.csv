   Angie, Angie, when will those clouds all disappear? 
 Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here? 
          With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats 
 You can't say we're satisfied 
      But Angie, Angie, you can't say we never tried 
  
 Angie, you're beautiful, but ain't it time we said good-bye? 
 Angie, I still love you, remember all those nights we cried? 
          All the dreams we held so close seemed to all go up in smoke 
 Let me whisper in your ear: 
 Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here? 
  
  
      Oh, Angie, don't you weep, all your kisses still taste sweet 
 I hate that sadness in your eyes 
      But Angie, Angie, ain't it time we said good-bye? 
  
  
          With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats 
 You can't say we're satisfied 
  
      But Angie, I still love you, baby 
 Ev'rywhere I look I see your eyes 
 There ain't a woman that comes close to you 
 Come on Baby, dry your eyes 
      But Angie, Angie, ain't it good to be alive?

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
                  You've been on my mind 
           I grow fonder every day 
               Lose myself in time 
              Just thinking of your face 
 God only knows 
           Why it's taken me so long 
                   To let my doubts go 
             You're the only one that I want 
  
  
 [Refrain]
  
               I don't know why I'm scared 
                    I've been here before 
             Every feeling  every word 
 I've imagined it all
     You'll never know if you never try 
   To forget your past and simply be mine 
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                I dare you to let me be your  your one and only 
                   Promise I'm worthy 
                  To hold in your arms 
                           So come on and give me a chance 
                    To prove I am the one who can
              walk that mile 
             Until the end starts 
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
                       If I've been on your mind 
              You hang on every word I say 
                   Lose yourself in time 
         At the mention of my name 
 Will I ever know 
         how it feels to hold you close 
               And have you tell me
             whichever road I choose  you'll go?
  
  
 [Refrain]
  
               I don't know why I'm scared 
                    I've been here before 
             Every feeling  every word 
 I've imagined it all
     You'll never know if you never try 
   To forget your past and simply be mine

                I dare you to let me be your  your one and only 
                   Promise I'm worthy 
                  To hold in your arms 
                           So come on and give me a chance 
                    To prove I am the one who can

 As you can see, it's nearly impssible to play on guitar when the bass note goes down to F,
 so I just play the chords: Eb  Gm  F  Bb
  
 I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
 I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

 Trust me I've learned it
 Nobody's pefect
 (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
 Trust me I've learned it
 Nobody's pefect

 Trust me I've learned it
 Nobody's pefect                         (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)

 Come on and give me a chance

 menuju pagi yang dingin

     bintang malam ini
 mungkin karena kau
         sedang cantik cantiknya

 semakin dalam

  kadang juga ia takut
 tatkala harus berpapasan

 [Verse 1]
 There's somethin' happenin' here.
          What it is ain't exactly clear.

            A-tellin' me I've got to beware.

 Everybody look what's goin' down.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 There's battle lines bein' drawn.
           Nobody's right if everybody's wrong.
 Young people speakin' their minds
            A-gettin' so much resistance from behind.

       Hey, what's that sound?
 Everybody look what's goin' down.
  
  
 [Verse 3]
 What a field day for the heat.
    A thousand people in the street
          Singin' songs and a-carryin' signs
          Mostly sayin' hooray for our side.

       Hey, what's that sound?
 Everybody look what's goin' down.
  
  
 [Verse 4]
 Paranoia strikes deep.
   Into your life it will creep.
 It starts when you're always afraid.
              Step out of line, the men come and take you away.
  
 [Chorus/Outro]
             You better stop.
       Hey, what's that sound?

       Hey, what's that sound?
 Everybody look what's goin'...
             You better stop.
       Now, what's that sound?

                      But say that you'll bring me along
                   To the world you see
                           To the world I close my eyes to see
              I close my eyes to see
  
 [Chorus: Hugh Jackman, Michelle Williams, together]
 Every night I lie in bed
 The brightest colors fill my head
     A million dreams are keeping me awake
  
 A million dreams, a million dreams
  
 I think of what the world could be
 A vision of the one I see
     A million dreams is all it's gonna take
     A million dreams for the world we're gonna make
  
 [Outro: Hugh Jackman & Michelle Williams]
                                For the world we're gonna make

 [Verse 1]
  
    I heard there was a secret chord      
       that David played and it pleased the Lord
      But you don't really care for music do ya
     It goes like this the fourth the fifth
      the minor fall and the major lift
      The baffled king composing hallelujah
       Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
       Your faith was strong but you needed proof
      You saw her bathing on the roof
      Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
      She tied you to a kitchen chair
      She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
      And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
        Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 Maybe I've been here before
    I know this room Ive walked this floor
    I used to live alone before I knew you
       I've seen your flag on the marble arch
      But Love is not a victory march
         It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
       Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

        There was a time you let me know
         What's real and going on below
      But now you never show it to me do you?
       I remember when I moved in you
      The holy dark was moving too
      And every breath we drew was hallelujah
       Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
  
  
 [Verse 5]
  
 Maybe there’s a God above
      But all I ever learned from love
      Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
      Its not the cry that you hear at night
       It's not someone who's seen the light
         It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
       Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
  
  
 [Verse 6]
  
      You say I took the name in vain
      But I don't even know the name
      But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
            There's a blaze of light in every word
     It doesn't matter which you heard
      The holy or the broken Hallelujah
       Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
  
  
 [Verse 7]
  
    I did my best, it wasn't much
    I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
       I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
      And even though it all went wrong
       I'll stand before the Lord of Song
       With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
     At first I was afraid, I was petrified,
                Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side.
             But then I spent so many nights, thinking how you did me wrong,
             And I grew strong; and I learned how to get along.
  
                 But now you're back, from outer space,
                I just walked in, to find you here, with that sad look upon your face.
                I should have changed that stupid lock,
                I should have made you leave your key,
           If I had known for just one second, you'd be back to bother me.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
             Go on now, go; walk out the door;
              Just turn a-round now, 'cos you're not welcome any more.
  Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
                    Did you think I'd crumble; did you think I'd lay down and die?
             Oh no, not I; I will sur-vive,
         Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive.
           I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give,
               And I'll sur-vive, I will sur-vive, I will sur-vive...
  
  
 [Interlude]
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
           It took all the strength I had not to fall apart.
                 Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart.
              And I spent oh, so many nights, just feeling sorry for myself,
            I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high.
              And you see me; somebody new,
               I'm not that chained up little person, still in love with you.
             And so you felt like dropping in and just ex-pect me to be free,
                Well, now I'm saving all my loving, for some-one who's loving me.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
             Go on now, go; walk out the door;
              Just turn a-round now, 'cos you're not welcome any more.
  Weren't you the one who tried to crush me with goodbye?
                    Did you think I'd crumble; did you think I'd lay down and die?
             Oh no, not I; I will sur-vive,
         And as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive.
           I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give,
      And I will survive, I-I-I will sur-vive.

 [Chorus]
                        I'm looking at you through the glass
                       Don't know how much time has passed
              Oh God, it feels like forever
  
 But no one ever tells you
         That forever feels like home
   Sitting all alone inside your head
  
                             Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                       Don't know how much time has passed
                         All I know is that it feels like forever
  
 But no one ever tells you
          That forever feels like home
   Sitting all alone inside your head
  
 [Verse 1]
               How do you feel?
                  That is the question
           But I forget
  
 You don't expect an easy answer
        When something like a soul
            Becomes initialized
                      And folded up like paper dolls and little notes
  
 You can't expect the bitter folks
         And while you're outside looking in
       Describing what you see
     Remember what you're staring at is me
  
 [Chorus]
                             Cause I'm looking at you through the glass

                         All I know is that it feels like forever
  
 And no one ever tells you
          That forever feels like home
   Sitting all alone inside your head
  
 [Verse 2]
               How much is real?
               So much to question
         An epidemic of the mannequins
  
 Contaminating everything
      we thought came from the heart
      It never did, right from the start
   Just listen to the noises (Null and void instead of voices)
   Before you tell yourself
        It's just a different scene
    Remember it's just different from what you've seen
  
 [Chorus]
                       I'm looking at you through the glass

                         All I know is that it feels like forever
  
 But no one ever tells you

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
    And another one bites the dust, - oh, why can I not conquer love?
    And I might have thought that we were one, wanted to fight this war without weapons
    And I wanted it, I wanted it bad, but there were so many red flags
    Now another one bites the dust, Yeah, let’s be clear, I’ll trust no one
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
   You did not break me
   I’m still fighting for peace
  
 [Chorus 1]
  
       Well I’ve got thick skin and an elastic heart, but your blade it might be too sharp
 I’m like a rubber band until you pull too hard, but I may snap when I move fast
      But you won’t see me fall apart
 Cause I’ve got an elastic heart
 I’ve got an elastic heart
 Yeah, I’ve got an elastic heart
  
 [Verse 2]
  
     And I will stay up through the night, and let's be clear, I won't close my eyes
     And I know that I can survive, I walked through fire to save my life
     And I want it, I want my life so bad, I'm doing everything I can
     Then another one bites the dust, it's hard to lose a chosen one

 [Chorus]
                         Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky
               Are like shooting stars
                        I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
                         Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky
               Are like shooting stars
                        I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
  
 [Verse 1]
        Yeah! I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
     To go back to a place much simpler than this
        Cause after all the partyin’ and smashin’ and crashin’
  And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
    And all the pandemonium and all the madness
   There comes a time when you fade to the blackness
   And when you’re staring at that phone in your lap
          And you hopin' but them people never call you back
  
   But that’s just how the story unfolds
      You get another hand soon after you fold
    And when your plans unravel in the sand
             What would you wish for if you had one chance?
  
     So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
      I'm on my way so don't close that gate
     If I don’t make that then I’ll switch my flight
               And I’ll be right back at it by the end of the night
  
 [Chorus]
                         Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky
               Are like shooting stars
                        I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
                         Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky
               Are like shooting stars

 [Verse 2]
           Somebody take me back to the days
                    Before this was a job, before I got paid
                 Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
                       Yeah back when I was tryin’ to get a tip at subway
  
                      And back when I was rappin’ for the hell of it
                    But now a days we rappin’ to stay relevant
                              I’m guessin that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes
                Then maybe yo maybe I’ll go back to the days
  
               Before the politics that we call the rap game
                        And back when ain’t nobody listened to my mix tape
                    And back before I tried to cover up my slang
                       But this is for the hater, what's up Bobby Ray
  
                 So can I get a wish to end the politics
                      And get back to the music that started this shit
             So here I stand and then again I say

 Berakhirlah sudah
        Kisah kita dalam percintaan 
               Yang menyakitkan 
              Pengorbanan ku selama ini 
             Hanya sia-sia...
  
 Cinta ku pada mu
        Begitu dalam 
              di lubuk hati ku 
               Benar sungguh-sungguh 
             Namun semua hancur 
              Dengan permainan dan sandiwara mu ...
  
 Hari-hari ku sepi selalu 
 Bila terkenangkan saat bersama mu 
                 Tapi itu semua tak akan kembali 
                Selama-lamanya... 
  
 [Chorus]
 Bila malam tiba di dalam tidurku
          Wajah ayu mu menghias mimipi ku 
                Namun itu semua hanya menyakitkan 
         Hati ini...hu...oo... 
  
 Satu hari nanti bila kau bertemu 
           Dengan seorang kekasih baru mu
                 Janganlah sekali sakiti hatinya 
              Seperti diri ku 
  
 Kini tiada lagi tinggal kenangan
             Saat bersama mu akan ku rindui
           Air mata ku mengalir di pipi 
             Aku menangis

 You and me we used to be together

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 When will I see you again?
                You left with no goodbye 
        Not a single word was said
     No final kiss to seal any sins
        I had no idea of the state we were in
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
                  I know I have a fickle heart
        And a bitterness
        And a wandering eye
        And a heaviness in my head
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                  But don't you remember?
              Don't you remember?
      The reason you loved me          before
                   Baby please remember me     once more
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 When was the last time that you thought of me?
                 Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
          I often think about where I went wrong
             The more I do     the less I know
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
                  I know I have a fickle heart
        And a bitterness
        And a wandering eye
        And a heaviness in my head
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                  But don't you remember?
              Don't you remember?
      The reason you loved me          before
                   Baby please remember me     once more
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 Gave you the space so you could breathe
  
            I kept my distance so you would be free
  
     In hope that you'd find the missing piece
  
     To bring you back to me
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                  Why don't you remember?
              Don't you remember?
      The reason you loved me          before
                   Baby please remember  me     once more

 When will I see you again?

 [Intro]
 |   
  
 [Verse 1]
     As soon as you're born they make you feel small
     By giving you no time instead of it all
           Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
    A working class hero is something to be
    A working class hero is something to be
  
  
 [Verse 2]
       They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
       They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
              Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
    A working class hero is something to be
    A working class hero is something to be
  
  
 [Verse 3]
               When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
 Then they expect you to pick a career
           When you can't really function you're so full of fear
    A working class hero is something to be
    A working class hero is something to be
  
  
 [Verse 4]
           Keep you doped with religion and sex and T.V.
          And you think you're so clever and classless and free
             But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
    A working class hero is something to be
    A working class hero is something to be
  
  
 [Verse 5]
          There's room at the top they are telling you still
      But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
         If you want to be like the folks on the hill
    A working class hero is something to be
    A working class hero is something to be

0,Use Somebody Acoustic chords,Use Somebody – Kings of Leon,"Hey guys,
  
 Just a little chord tab of how I play Use Somebody by The Kings of Leon on
 acoustic. The Em DOES work and a few of the suggested replacements really don't sound right at all.
 I also didn't tab the bridge because I don't think it flows well on acoustic as it goes straight 
 into the solo
 on the original version. Capo on 1st fret optional. All chords are the standard chords.

 better. Other than that, i hope you guys have a really awesome time playing a
 really awesome song!
  Please rate and comment what you thought, as this is my first tab. Feedback MUCH

 -----Edit-----
  
 When playing the F chord in the verses try and let your finger catch the high E string
 you got for an up strum :) just adds a little something extra in there.

 Notes: In the original version the whole song is played in dropped D and begins
        with an E chord. If you want to play like in the original, you must tune your
        guitar one step down and transpose the chords one step up.
        You can mute strings in the intro and verse and play normally in the 'yeah'
        lines - it will make playing more dynamic.

0,Behind Blue Eyes chords,Behind Blue Eyes – The Who,"Here's my version of the Who's ""Behind Blue Eyes"" for acoustic guitar.
 I've given the chords - just listen to the song to put them where they
 need to go - I like to use sus chords in place of many major and minor
 chords because it leaves the voicings open to interpretation - However,
 you can replace my sus chords with either major or minor chords, you'll
 just need to see which works best for you (the original Who version has
 dedicated major or minor chords) - it's a great song, so have fun.

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
   No one knows what it's like
              to be the bad man
               to be the sad man
     behind blue eyes
  
 No one knows what it's like
              to be hated
               to be fated
     to telling only lies
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
             But my dreams
                they aren't as empty
          as my conscience seems to be
            I have hours, only lonely
                  my love is vengeance
                thats never free
  
  
 [Verse]
  
   No one knows what it's like
              to feel these feelings
               like I do
     and I blame you
  
   No one bites back as hard
              on their anger
               none of my pain and woe
     can show through
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
             But my dreams
                they aren't as empty
          as my conscience seems to be
            I have hours, only lonely
                  my love is vengeance
                 that's never free
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
  
   When my fist clenches, crack it open
 Before I use it and lose my cool
         When I smile, tell me some bad news
           Before I laugh and act like a fool
 And if I swallow anything evil
 Put your finger down my throat
           And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
          Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

 [Verse 1]
 I had a dream
 I got everything I wanted
 Not what you think
 And if I'm being honest
                         It might have been a nightmare
                 To anyone who might care
 Thought I could fly
 So I stepped off the Golden
 Nobody cried
   Nobody even noticed
                      I saw them standing right there
                      Kinda thought they might care
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 I had a dream
 I got everything I wanted
      But when I wake up I see
 You're with me
          And you say
  
  
 [Chorus]
              As long as I'm here
 No one can hurt you
 Don't wanna lie here
 But you can learn to
 If I could change
      The way that you see yourself
 You wouldn't wonder why you hear
 ""They don't deserve you""
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 I tried to scream
 But my head was under water
 They called me weak
 Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
                    Could've been a nightmare
                              But it felt like they were right there
         And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
     But I don't wanna let anybody know
          Cause everybody wants something from me now
     And I don't wanna let 'em down
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 I had a dream
 I got everything I wanted
      But when I wake up I see
 You're with me
          And you say
  
  
 [Chorus]
              As long as I'm here

 You wouldn't wonder why you hear
 ""They don't deserve you""
  
 [Bridge]
 If I knew it all then
                 Would I do it again
                 Would I do it again
 If they knew what they said
                          Would go straight to my head
                       What would they say instead
  
 If I knew it all then

 [Verse 1]
  
 I think I've had enough, I might get a little drunk
 I say what's on my mind, I might do a little time
 Cause all of my kindness, is taken for weakness
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
          Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
         And we got three more days 'til Friday
           I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'
    I swear I wish somebody would tell me
 Ooh thats all I want
  
  
 [Verse 2 ]
  
 Woke up an optimist, sun was shining I'm positive
 Then I heard you was talkin' trash
 Hold me back I'm bout' to spaz
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
          Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
         And we got three more days 'til Friday
           I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'
    I swear I wish somebody would tell me
 Ooh thats all I want
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 And I know that you're up tonight
         Thinkin' how could I be so selfish
 But you called bout a thousand times wondering where I been
 Now I know that your up tonight
            Thinkin' how could I be so reckless
 But I just can't apologize, I hope you can understand
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 If I go to jail tonight, promise you'll pay my bail
 See they want to buy my pride, but that just ain't up for sale
 See all of my kindness, is taken for weakness
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
          Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
         And we got three more days 'til Friday

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 You got a fast car,
 I want a ticket to anywhere.
 Maybe we make a deal,
 Maybe together we can  get somewhere.
 Any place is better.
 Starting from zero, got nothing to lose.
 Maybe we'll make something,
 Me myself, I got nothing to prove.
  
  
 [Link 1]
  
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 You got a fast car
 And I got a plan to get us out of here
         I been working at the convenience store
 Managed to save just a little bit of money
 Won't have to drive too far
        Just cross the border and into the city
 You and I can both get jobs
      And finally see what it means to be living

 [Verse 3]
  
          You see my old man's got a problem
     He live with the bottle that's the way it is
              He says his body's too old for working
       His body's too young to look like his
     My mama went off and left him
       She wanted more from life than he could give
           I said, ""somebody's got to take care of him""
      So I quit school and that's what I did
  
  
 [Link]
  
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
 You got a fast car
             But is it fast enough so we can fly away
 We gotta make a decision
 We leave tonight or live and die this way
  
  
 [Link]
  
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
  
 I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
      The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
 City lights lay out before us
           And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
      And I.... had a feeling that I belonged
      And I.... had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
  
  
 [Link]
  
  
  
 [Verse 5]
  
 You got a fast car
      And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
      You still ain't got a job
        And I work in a market as a checkout girl
 I know things will get better
 You'll find work and I'll get promoted
 Well move out of the shelter
 Buy a big house and live in the suburbs
  
  
 [Link]
  
  
  
 [Chorus 2]
  
 I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
      The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
 City lights lay out before us
           And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
      And I.... had a feeling that I belonged
      And I.... had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
  
  
 [Link]
  
  
  
 [Verse 6]
  
 You got a fast car
      And I got a job that pays all our bills
      You stay out drinking late at the bar
      See more of your friends than you  do of your kids
 I'd always hoped for better
          Thought maybe together you and me would find it
 I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
     So take your fast car and keep on driving

 [Verse 1]
 The moon and stars they wept
                       The morning sun was dead
                      The Savior of the world was fallen
   His body on the cross
                           His blood poured out for us

         Well, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load,
                       I've got seven women on my mind.
 Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me,
   one says she's a friend of mine. 
          Take it easy, take it ea - sy, 
                don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy. 
          Lighten up while you still can, don't even try to under-stand, 
              just find a place to make your stand and take it easy. 
              Well, I'm a standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona 
                  and such a fine sight to see: 
         it's a girl, my Lord, in a flat bed Ford 
          slowin' down to take a look at me. 
           Come on, ba - by, don't say may - be. 
          I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me. 
         We may lose and we may win though we will never be here a-gain. 
          So open up, I'm climbin' in, so take it easy.

 I'm afraid of all I am
     My mind feels like a foreign land
 Silence ringing inside my head
          Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 I spent all of the love I've saved
 We were always a losing game
 Small-town boy in a big arcade
 I got addicted to a losing game
  
  
 [Chorus]
 Ooh, ooh
        All I know, all I know
 Loving you is a losing game
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 How many pennies in the slot?
 Giving us up didn't take a lot
 I saw the end 'fore it begun
           Still I carried, I carried, I carry on
  
  
 [Chorus]
 Ooh, ooh
        All I know, all I know
 Loving you is a losing game
 Ooh, ooh
         All I know, all I know
 Loving you is a losing game
  
  
 [Bridge]
 I don't need your games, game over
 Get me off this rollercoaster
  
  
 [Chorus]
 N.C.
 Ooh, ooh
  
 All I know, all I know
  
 Loving you is a losing game
 Ooh, ooh
        All I know, all I know
 Loving you is a losing game
  
  
 [Outro]
 Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
 Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

 [Verse 1]
  
 It's a god-awful small affair
             To the girl with the mousy hair
    But her mummy is yelling ""No""
                                                 And her daddy has told her to go
 But her friend is nowhere to be seen
             Now she walks through her sunken dream.
 To the seat with the clearest view
  
 And she's hooked to the silver screen
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 But the film is a saddening bore
                For she's lived it ten times or more
 She could spit in the eyes of fools
               As they ask her to focus on
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Sailors fighting in the dance hall
 Oh man! look at those cavemen go
 It's the freakiest show
 Take a look at the lawman
 Beating up the wrong guy
 Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
    He's in the best selling show
 Is there life on Mars?

 It's on Amerika's tortured brow
             That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
 Now the workers have struck for fame
                                                 'Cause Lennon's on sale again
 See the mice in their million hordes
             From Ibeza to the norfolk broads
 Rule Britannia is out of bounds
  
 To my mother, my dog, and clowns

 [Verse 1]
  
           Is there anybody going to listen to my story
 All about the girl who came to stay?
            She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
 Still you don't regret a single day

     Ah girl      
     Ah girl      
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
         When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
 She will turn to me and start to cry
          And she promises the earth to me and I believe her
 After all this time I don't know why
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Ah girl

 She's the kind of girl who puts you down
                                      When friends are there, you feel a fool
 When you say she's looking good
      She acts as if it's understood, she's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Ah girl      
     Ah girl      
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
          Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
 Did she understand it when they said
         That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure,
 Will she still believe it when he's dead?

 Shadows settle on the place, that you left.
 Our minds are troubled by the emptiness.
 Destroy the middle, it's a waste of time.
           From the perfect start to the finish line.
         And if you're still breathing, you're the lucky ones.
         'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs.
          Setting fire to our insides for fun
             Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
      The lovers that went wrong.
  
 [Interlude]
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 We are the reckless, We are the wild youth
           Chasing visions of our futures
 One day we'll reveal the truth
                That one will die before he gets there.
         And if you're still bleeding, you're the lucky ones.
         'Cause most of our feelings, they are dead and they are gone.
                We're setting fire to our insides for fun.
             Collecting pictures from the flood that wrecked our home,

 Well I've lost it all, I'm just a silhouette, 
 A lifeless face that you'll soon forget, 
 My eyes are damp from the words you left, 
           Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest.
           Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest.
         And if you're in love, then you are the lucky one, 
         'Cause most of us are bitter over someone.
          Setting fire to our insides for fun, 
        To distract our hearts from ever missing them.
            But I'm forever missing him.

 I feel so unsure
       As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
 As the music dies
 Something in your eyes
 Calls to mind a silver screen
      And all its sad goodbyes

 I'm never gonna dance again
 Guilty feet have got no rhythm
 Though it's easy to pretend
    I know you're not a fool
 Should've known better than to cheat a friend
      And waste the chance that I've been given
 So, I'm never gonna dance again

 You got this room for two
 One thing I've left to do

 You with the sad eyes
 Don't be discouraged
 Oh I realize
          It's hard to take courage
 In a world full of people
      You can lose sight of it all
          And the darkness inside you
          Can make you feel so small

 [Verse]
  
 A hundred days have made me older,
            Since the last time that I saw your pretty face,
  
 A thousand lies have made me colder,
         And I don't think I can look at this the same,
 And all the miles that separate,
 They disappear now when I'm dreamin' of your face.

 Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?

 Wouldn't you think I'm the girl, the girl who has everything?
 Look at this trove, treasures untold
 How many wonders can one cavern hold?
 Looking around here you'd think
 Sure, she's got everything

 I wanna see, wanna see them dancin'

 Strolling along down a - what's that word again?

 Chord Notes: This song drives on the 2nd string B, C# and D for the Riff.
 (Open B/2nd string, C# 2nd fret/2nd string and D 3rd fret/2nd string)
 Keep this in mind when fretting and strumming the following chords.
 i.e. play the Em7 with your pinky on the D 3rd fret/2nd string instead of the familiar
 one finger on the 2nd fret/5th string.
  
  
 [Intro]
  
 [Verse]
 Sometimes, I feel the fear of un---certainty stinging clear
 And I can't help but ask myself how much
         I'll let the fear take the wheel and steer.
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague -----haunting mass appeal.
 But lately I'm beginning to find that I------should be the one behind the wheel.
  
 [Chorus]
 Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
    with open arms and open eyes, Yeah
    Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there..I'll be there.

 Will I choose water over wine and hold my own and drive? Ahaa-aa-aa-aa.

 But lately I'm beginning to find that when I drive myself my light is found.

 [Verse 1]
  
   You are the one, girl
                           You know that it's true
     I'm feeling younger
                                 Every time that I'm alone with you
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
     We were sitting in a parked car
     Stealing kisses in a front yard
    We got questions we shouldn't had asked but
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                     How would you feel
                            If I told you I loved you
                                     It's just something that I want to do
                I'm taking my time, spending my life
                               Falling deeper in love with you
                               So tell me that you love me too
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
    In the summer, as the lilacs bloom
    Love flows deeper than a river
                                 Every moment that I spend with you
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
    We were sat upon our best friend's roof
                               I had both of my arms around you
                                   Watching the sunrise replace the moon

      Hey you! standing in the aisles
                                             With itchy feet and fading smiles, can you feel me?
 Hey you! don't you help them to bury the li-ii-ght
 Don't give in without a fight

                                        Sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me?
      Hey you! with your ear against the wall
                                             Waiting for someone to call out, would you touch me?
 Hey you! would you help me to carry the sto-o-one?
 Open your heart, I'm coming home

 But it was only a fantasy
 The wall was too high, as you can see
 No matter how he tried he could not break free
          And the worms ate into his brain

                                        Breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me?

 [Verse]
         It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
 Caught somewhere between a boy and man
 She was 17 and she was far from in between
         It was summertime in Northern Michigan
  
 [Instrumental]

     Splashin' thru the sandbar, talkin' by the campfire
            It's the simple things in life like when and where
      We didn't have no internet, but man I never will forget
      The way the moonlight shined upon her hair
  
 [Chorus]
              And we were tryin' different things and we were smokin' funny things
         Makin' love out by the lake to our favorite songs

 [Intro]
   To lead a better life,
   I need my love to be here
  
  
 [Verse]
 Here,      making each day of the year
 Changing my life with a wave of her hand,
 Nobody can deny that there's something there
  
  
 [Verse]
 There,     running my hands through her hair
 Both of us thinking how good it can be
 Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there
  
  
 [Middle 8]
    I want her everywhere
         And if she's beside me I know I need never care
 But to love her is to need her 
  
  
 [Verse]
 everywhere     knowing that love is to share,
 Each one believing that love never dies
 Watching her eyes, and hoping I'm always there

 You, with your words like knives and swords
                       And weapons that you use against me 
 You, have knocked me off my feet again
         Got me feelin' like a nothin'
 You, with your voice like nails on a chalk board
             Callin' me out when I'm wounded
 You, pickin' on the weaker man

 You, with your swithching sides and

 You, have pointed out my flaws again

 I walk with my head down

 I just wanna feel okay again

 Somebody made you cold
 But the cycle ends right now 'cause
 You can't lead me down that road

 Washed up and ranting about the 
 same old bitter things
 Drunk and rumblin' all about how I can't sing
 N.C.               But all you are is mean
 All you are is mean, and a liar, and pathetic
      And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

 [Verse 1]
  
          I got a heart and I got a soul
    Believe me I will use them both
            We made a start
          Be it a false one, I know
        Baby, I don’t want to feel alone

     So kiss me where I lay down, my hands press to your cheeks
    A long way from the playground
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 I have loved you since we were 18 (18,18)
 Long before we both thought the same thing  (same thing)
        To be loved, to be in love
            All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you, oho-oho
          I wanna love like you made me feel
 When we were 18
  
  
 [Verse 2]
            We took a chance   ('chance' will NEVER EVER be changed to 'chonce'!! It's his accent!)
               God knows we tried
      Yet all along, I knew we’d be fine
               So pour me a drink, oh love
                  Let’s split the night wide open and we’ll see everything we can 
                        Live in love and slow motion, motion, motion

 [Verse 1]
  
 Say you're sorry
          That face of an angel
           Comes out just when you need it to
 As I paced back and forth all this time
          Cause I honestly believed in you
  
 Holding on
      The days drag on
         Stupid girl,
  
 I should have known, I should have known
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                    That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
              I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
       Lead her up the stairwell
             This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
              I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
           Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Maybe I was naïve,
  
 Got lost in your eyes
      And never really had a chance
 My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
             You had to fight to have the upper hand
  
        I had so many dreams
        About you and me
        Happy endings
 Now I know

 Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
 Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

 [Verse 1]
  
 Sometimes late at night
 I lie awake and watch her sleeping
        She's lost in peaceful dreams
            So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
 And the thought crosses my mind
 If I never wake up in the morning
 Would she ever doubt the way I feel
 About her in my heart
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 If tomorrow never comes
                           Will she know how much I loved her
                     Did I try in every way to show her every day
       That she's my only one
            And if my time on earth were through
                         And she must face this world without me
 Is the love I gave her in the past
                     Gonna be enough to last
                    If tomorrow never comes
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 'Cause I've lost love ones in my life
 Who never knew how much I loved them
        Now I live with the regret
               That my true feelings for them never were revealed
 So I made a promise to myself
 To say each day how much she means to me
      And avoid that circumstance
                   Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 If tomorrow never comes
                           Will she know how much I loved her
                     Did I try in every way to show her every day
       That she's my only one
            And if my time on earth were through
                         And she must face this world without me
 Is the love I gave her in the past
                     Gonna be enough to last
                    If tomorrow never comes

 So tell that someone that you love
                            Just what you`re thinking of

 White lips, pale face
             Breathing in snowflakes
      Burnt lungs, sour taste.
 Light's gone, day's end
              Struggling to pay rent
      Long nights, strange men.
  
  
    And they say she's in the Class A Team
               Stuck in her daydream.
                   Been this way since eighteen, but lately
      Her face seems slowly sinking, wasting,
                Crumbling like pastries and they scream
            The worst things in life come free to us.
  
  
          Cos we're just under the upperhand,
 And go mad for a couple grams,
 And she don't want to go outside tonight.
          And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland,
 Or sells love to another man.
       It's too cold outside
                 For angels to fly
              Angels to fly.
  
  
 Ripped gloves, raincoat,
                   Tried to swim and stay afloat,
    Dry house, wet clothes.
 Loose change, bank notes,
              Weary eyed, dry throat,
     Call girl, no phone.
  
  
    And they say she's in the Class A Team
               Stuck in her daydream.
                   Been this way since eighteen, but lately
      Her face seems slowly sinking, wasting,
                Crumbling like pastries and they scream
            The worst things in life come free to us.
  
  
          Cos we're just under the upperhand,
 And go mad for a couple grams,
 And she don't want to go outside tonight.
          And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland,
 Or sells love to another man.
       It's too cold outside
                 For angels to fly
                An angel will die, covered in white
         Closed eye and hoping for a better life
 This time, we’ll fade out tonight, straight down the line.
  
  
    And they say she's in the Class A Team
               Stuck in her daydream.
                   Been this way since eighteen, but lately

       It's too cold outside
                 For angels to fly
              Angels to fly.
  
  
 To fly, fly.
            Angels to fly, to fly, to fly
           Angels to die.

 [Verse 1]
            Do I look lonely? I see the shadows on my face,
              People have told me, I don't look the same,
          Maybe I lost weight, I'm playing hooky,
                       With the best of the best, put my heart on my chest so that you can see it too,
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]

 [Verse 2]
                 I'm cutting my mind off, It feel like my heart is going to burst,
             Alone at a table for two and I just wanna be served,
               And when you think of me, am I the best you've ever had?
                 Share one more drink with me, smile even though you're sad.

 [Verse 1]
 Elevator buttons and morning air
 Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
 If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
            But right now, my time is theirs
     Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
          They'll judge it like they know about me and you
          And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
             The jury's out, but my choice is you
  
 [Chorus]
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind
 People throw rocks at things that shine
      And life makes love look hard
                 The stakes are high
              The waters rough
                   But this love is ours
  
 [Verse 2]
      You never know what people have up their sleeves
 Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
 Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
               But I don't care, cause right now you're mine
  
 [Chorus]
                 And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
 People throw rocks at things that shine
      And life makes love look hard
                 The stakes are high
              The waters rough
                  But this love is ours
  
 [Bridge]
 And it's not theirs to speculate
          If it's wrong and      your hands are tough but they are where mine belong and
    I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for   you
  
 [Verse 3]
 Cause I love the gap between your teeth
 And I love the riddles that you speak
          And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
 Cause my heart is yours
  
 [Chorus/Outro]
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind
 People throw rocks at things that shine
      And life makes love look hard
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind
 People throw rocks at things that shine
      But they can't take what's ours
 They can't take what's ours
                 The stakes are high
             The waters rough
                   But this love is ours

 [Verse]
  
 When I walk beside her
    I am the better man
 When I look to leave her
          I always stagger back again
  
 Once I built an Ivory tower
       so I could worship from above
 When I climb down to be set free
      she took me in again
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 there's a big
             A big hard sun

                  in the big hard world
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 When she comes to greet me
         She is mercy at my feet
 When I see her pin her charm
          She just throws it back at me
  
 Once I dug an early grave
     To find a better land
 She just smiled and laughed at me
           And took her bruise back again
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 there's a big

 When I go to cross that river
           She is comfort by my side
 When I try to understand
 She just opens up her hands

 Once I stood to lose her
         when I saw what I had done
 bound down and flew away the hours
         of her garden and her sun
  
 so I tried to warn her
    I turned to see her weep
 40 days and 40 nights
           and it's still coming down on me

   Feeling used but I'm
   Still missing you and I can't
   See the end of this
             Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
          And now all this time is passing by
      But I still can't seem to tell you why
     It hurts me every time I see you
 Realize how much I need you

    I miss you when I can't sleep
     Or right after coffee, or right when I can't eat
    I miss you in my front seat
            Still got sand in my sweaters, from nights we don't remember
   Do you miss me like I miss you?
   Fucked around and got attached to you
   Friends can break your heart too, and
 I'm always tired but never of you
 If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
 I put this real out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
 I type a text but then I never mind that shit
 I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
 Oh oh, keep it on the low
         You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
 If you wanted me you would just say so
      And if I were you, I would never let me go
 I don't mean no harm
         I just miss you on my arm
          Wedding bells were just alarms
          Caution tape around my heart
   You ever wonder what we coulda been?
   You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
   Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
   Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
 Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
                Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
              I know that I control my thoughts, and I should stop reminiscing 
        But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
       When love and trust are gone
  
 I guess this is moving on
 Everyone I do right does me wrong
     So every lonely night, I sing this song
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
    I hate you I love you
    I hate that I love you
        Don't want to, but I can't put

    I hate that I want you
      You want her, you need her
      And I'll never be her

 All alone I watch you watch her
                 Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
 You don't care you never did
 You don't give a damn about me
        Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
            She's the only thing you've ever seen
 How is it you never notice
       That you are slowly killing me

  Something always brings me back to you.
  It never takes too long.
  No matter what I say or do
         I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone.
  You hold me without touch.
  You keep me without chains.
  I never wanted anything so much
            Than to drown in your love and not feel
         your rain.

         Set me free, leave me be.
                   I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.

 But you're on to me and all over me.

  When I thought that I was strong.
  But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone.

 I based this on Avril's Live performance at AOL's Sessions (see link),
 so it's really detailed.  It's good for just VOCAL & GUITAR performance,

 [Verse 1]
     In Christ alone my hope is found,
 He is my light, my strength, my song;
       This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
 Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
       What heights of love, what depths of peace,
       When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
     My Comforter, my All in All,
 Here in the love of Christ I stand.
  
 [Verse 2]
     In Christ alone! Who took on flesh
 Fullness of God in helpless babe!
       This gift of love and righteousness
 Scorned by the ones he came to save:
       Till on that cross as Jesus died,
      The wrath of God was satisfied
      For every sin on Him was laid;
 Here in the death of Christ I live.
  
 [Verse 3]
        There in the ground His body lay
 Light of the world by darkness slain:
        Then bursting forth in glorious Day
 Up from the grave he rose again!
      And as He stands in victory
        Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
      For I am His and He is mine
 Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
  
 [Verse 4]
     No guilt in life, no fear in death,
 This is the power of Christ in me;
       From life's first cry to final breath.
 Jesus commands my destiny.
     No power of hell, no scheme of man,
      Can ever pluck me from His hand;
       Till He returns or calls me home,
 Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.

 [Intro]
  
 (Top 4 strings picked slowly down then up)
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
                                                   I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
                                     Who will dance on the floor in the round
                    She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
  
 She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
                                                             Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
                                     Who will dance on the floor in the round
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 People always told me be careful of what you do
        Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
      And mother always told me be careful of who you love
         And be careful of what you do before the lie becomes the truth
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Billie Jean is not my lover
               She's just a girl who says that I am the one
          But the kid is     not   my son
                    She says I am the one
          But the kid is     not   my son
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 For forty days and for forty nights. The law was on her side.
                                                          But who can stand when she's in demand. Her schemes and plans.
                                       'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
                      So take my strong advice, remember to always think twice
 (Do think twice)
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
                                                       Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine
                                       'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 People always told me be careful of what you do
        Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
           Then she stood right by me. The smell of sweet perfume.
       This happened much too soon. She called me to her room.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Billie Jean is not my lover
               She's just a girl who says that I am the one
          But the kid is     not   my son
                    She says I am the one
          But the kid is     not   my son
                      So take my strong advice, remember to always think twice

 Hurricane - Bob Dylan
 CRDs by Steve Vetter & TSOBD
  
  
 [Intro]
  
 |   
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
 Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
      She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
  Cries out ""My God they killed them all!""
  
 Here comes the story of the Hurricane,
    The man the authorities came to blame
  For something that he never done
  Put in a prison cell but one time 
                He could have been the champion of the world
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 |   
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Three bodies lyin’ there does Patty see
 And another man named Bello, movin’ around mysteriously
 “I didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands
 “I was only robbin’ the register, I hope you understand
 I saw them leavin’,” he says, and he stops
 “One of us had better call up the cops”
 And so Patty calls the cops
 And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin’
                In the hot New Jersey night
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 |   
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
 Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin’ around
 Number one contender for the middleweight crown
 Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
 When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
 Just like the time before and the time before that
 In Paterson that’s just the way things go
 If you’re black you might as well not show up on the street
                ’Less you wanna draw the heat
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 |   
  
 [Verse 4]
  
 Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
 Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin’ around
 He said, “I saw two men runnin’ out, they looked like middleweights
 They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”
 And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
 Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
 So they took him to the infirmary
 And though this man could hardly see
                They told him that he could identify the guilty men
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 |   
  
 [Verse 5]
  
 Four in the mornin’ and they haul Rubin in
 Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
 The wounded man looks up through his one dyin’ eye
 Says, “Wha’d you bring him in here for? He ain’t the guy!”
 Yes, here’s the story of the Hurricane
 The man the authorities came to blame
 For somethin’ that he never done
 Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
                The champion of the world
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 |   
  
 [Verse 6]
  
 Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
 Rubin’s in South America, fightin’ for his name
 While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game
 And the cops are puttin’ the screws to him, lookin’ for somebody to blame
 “Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”
 “Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”
 “You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”
 “Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin’ that night?”
                “Don’t forget that you are white”
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 |   
  
 [Verse 7]
  
 Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”
 Cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break
 We got you for the motel job and we’re talkin’ to your friend Bello
 Now you don’t wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
 You’ll be doin’ society a favor
 That sonofabitch is brave and gettin’ braver
 We want to put his ass in stir
 We want to pin this triple murder on him
                He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 |   
  
 [Verse 8]
  
 Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
 But he never did like to talk about it all that much
 It’s my work, he’d say, and I do it for pay
 And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way
 Up to some paradise
 Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
 And ride a horse along a trail
 But then they took him to the jailhouse
                Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 |   
  
 [Verse 9]
  
 All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance
 The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
 The judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums
 To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
 And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
 No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
 And though they could not produce the gun
 The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
                And the all-white jury agreed
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 |   
  
 [Verse 10]
  
 Rubin Carter was falsely tried
 The crime was murder “one,” guess who testified?
 Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
 And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride
 How can the life of such a man
 Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
 To see him obviously framed
 Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
                Where justice is a game
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 |   
  
 [Verse 11]
  
 Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
 Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
 While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
 An innocent man in a living hell
 That’s the story of the Hurricane
 But it won’t be over till they clear his name
 And give him back the time he’s done
 Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
                The champion of the world

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
 Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
 Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
 My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim,
 I had to stop for the night
  
 There she stood in the doorway;
 I heard the mission bell
 And I was thinking to myself,
                this could be heaven or this could be hell
 Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
 There were voices down the corridor,
 I thought I heard them say...
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Welcome to the hotel California;
         such a lovely place,
         such a lovely face
 Plenty of room at the hotel California,
      any time of year, you can find it here
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Her mind is tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz
 She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
 How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
 Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
  
 So I called up the captain,
 please bring me my wine
              He said, we haven t had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine
 And still those voices are calling from far away
 Wake you up in the middle of the night,
 just to hear them say
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Welcome to the hotel California;
         such a lovely place,
         such a lovely face
 They re living it up at the hotel California
         What a nice surprise, bring your alibis
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 Mirrors on the ceiling,
 the pink champagne on ice
               And she said we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
 And in the master s chambers,
 they gathered for the feast
 The stab it with their steely knives,
           but they just can t kill the beast
  
 Last thing I remember, I was
 running for the door
 I had to find the passage back,
         to the place I was before
 relax, said the night man,
         we are programmed to receive.
 You can checkout any time you like,
 but you can never leave!

 [Verse 1]
  
   You look so wonderful in your dress
   I love your hair like that
   The way it falls on the side of your neck
    Down your shoulders and back
  
   We are surrounded by all of these lies
      And people who talk too much
    You've got that kind of look in your eyes
           As if no one knows anything but us
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus 1]
  
      And should this be the last thing I see
    I want you to know it's enough for me
        Cause all that you are is all   that I'll   ever need

        so in love
        So in love,
        so in love
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
   You look so beautiful in this light
   Your silhouette   over me
   The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
          Is the Tenerife   Sea
  
 And all of the voices surrounding us here
            They just fade out   when you take a breath
 Just say the word and I will disappear

 [Chorus]
  
 Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
          It's empty and cold without you here,
            Too many people to ache over
 I see my vision burn, 
 I feel my memories fade with time
      But I'm too young to worry
 These streets we travel on
                                  Will undergo our same lost past
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 I found you here, now please just stay for a while
             I can move on with you around
               I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever?
 I'd do anything for a smile,
               Holding you till our time is done
                   We both know the day will come
      But I don't want to leave you

 Newborn life replacing all of us, 
                  Changing this fable we live in
               No longer needed here so where do we go?
 Will you take a journey tonight,
             Follow me past the walls of death?
            But girl, what if there is no eternal life?

 Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost

 Trials in life, questions of us existing here,

 [Verse 1]
              There ain't no gold in this river
                  That I've been washing my hands in forever
 I know there is hope in these waters
               But I can't bring myself to swim
      When I am drowning in this silence
              Baby, let me in

 I need you boo
 I gotta see you boo
 And there’s hearts all over the world tonight
 Said there’s hearts all over the world tonight
 I need you boo
 I gotta see you boo
 And there’s hearts all over the world tonight

 Hey lil mama, ooh you’re a stunner
 Hot little figure, yes you a winner, and
 I’m so glad to be yours
 You’re a class of your own and
 Ooh little cutie, when you talk to me
 I swear the whole world stops
 You’re my sweetheart and
 I’m so glad that you’re mine
 You are one of a kind, and

    You mean to me      what I mean to you
      And together baby there is nothing we won’t do

   I don’t need money
 I don’t need cars
 Girl you’re my heart

 I gotta have you and I cannot wait now
 Hey lil shorty, say you care for me
 You know I care for you
 You know that I will be true
 You know that I won’t lie
 You know that I will try

 And I will never try
 To deny that you are my whole life
  
  
 ‘Cause if you ever let me go
 I would die so I won’t run
  
 I don’t need another woman
 I just need you or nothing
  
 ‘Cause if I got that
 Then I’ll be straight
 Baby you’re the best part of my day

 There's a fire starting in my heart,
 Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
 Finally, I can see you crystal clear.
 Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.
  
 See how I leave, with every piece of you
 Don't underestimate the things that I will do.
 There's a fire starting in my heart,
 Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

                     Shadows on the hills,       Sketch the trees and daffodils

       You took your life as lovers often do
         But I could have told you, Vincent, this world was

 View to all the critics, I decided to make some corrections to make it easier to read.
  
 PRECISIONS ON CHORDS: It is hard to figure out how to name these chords with such a
 tuning. So I just decided to name them according to the prominent bass note and I gave for
 a number if necessary. Also, when the chord includes notes that are at 10th fret or more,
 decided to put – between the strings to avoid confusion (example: D1 : 0-12-12-000). It
 is really easy to play, but just have the patience to figure out with the chords. If it is
 too confusing for you, take a pen and write over each chords the way to play it so you don't
 have to get back to the list all the time.
  
 TUNING : BDDDDD (E down to B; A down to D; D stays the same;
                  G down to D; B UP to D; E down to D)

           And I’d give up forever to touch you
           Cause I know that you feel me somehow
              You’re the closest to heaven that I’ll ever be
         And I don’t wanna go home right now

       And all I could taste is this moment

 There's a shadow hanging over me

                                 You gave me something that I didn't have
               But had no use
                         I was too weak to give in
                   Too strong to lose
                       My heart is under arrest again
                  But I break loose
                       My head is giving me life or death
                 But I can't choose
                      I swear I'll never give in
         I refuse

          I'm no fool
                       I'm getting tired of starting again
            Somewhere new
                    Were you born to resist or be abused?
                          I swear I'll never give in

 [Verse]
  
 I love this place
           But it's haunted without you
 My tired heart
             Is beating so slow
 Our hearts sing less
          Than we wanted

 Our hearts sing 'cause

 [Verse]
  
 I remember what you wore on the first day
 You came into my life and I thought
 ""Hey, you know, this could be something""
 'Cause everything you do and words you say
 You know that it all takes my breath away
 And now I'm left with nothing

                    'Cause maybe it's true
               That I can't live without you
        Maybe two is better than one
                  There's so much time

 I remember every look upon your face
 The way you roll your eyes
              The way you taste
              You make it hard for breathing
 'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
 I think of you and everything's okay
 I'm finally now believing
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                   That maybe it's true
                That I can't live without you
        Maybe two is better than one
                  There's so much time
     To figure out the rest of my life
          And you thought that it got me coming undone

 Two is better than one

 [Verse]
  
 I'm so tired of being here
 Suppressed by all my childish fears
 And if you have to leave
 I wish that you would just leave
 'Cause your presence still lingers here
 And it won't leave me alone
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 These wounds won't seem to heal
 This pain is just too real
 There's just too much that time cannot erase
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
 When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
 I held your hand through all of these years
 But you still have
 All of me
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 You used to captivate me
 By your resonating light
 Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
 Your face it haunts
 My once pleasant dreams
 Your voice it chased away
 All of the sanity in me

 But though you're still with me
 I've been alone all along

 [Verse 1]
  
       On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,
    I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
     So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
       'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
           He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
      and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
         And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.
        For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice.""
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
       So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow. 
 Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
          And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
                   Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.

 [Verse 4] (transpose +1 here if you want to play it correctly)
  
 Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
     is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
         'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and ev'ry hand's a loser,
          and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.""
  
  
 [Verse 5]
  
      And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,
 crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
      And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
      But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
             You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,

   Jimmy quit and Jody got married - shoulda known we'd never get far

 Today I don't feel like doing anything

 Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
  
  
 - Verse:
  
      Uh, I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
 Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
 Nobody's gonna tell me I can't, nah

 Click to MTV so they can teach me how to dougie
 Cause in my castle I'm the freakin' man

 Tomorrow I wake up, do some P90X
 Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
 And she's gonna scream out, ""this is great"" (Oh my God, this is great)

 I bet my old man will be so proud of me
 I'm sorry pops, you'll just have to wait

 Girl I'm in love with you
 This ain't the honeymoon
 Past the infatuation phase.
 Right in the thick of love
 At times we get sick of love
 It seems like we argue every day.
                     I know I misbehave and you made your mistakes and we both still got room left to grow.  
                    And though love sometimes hurt, I still put you first and we'll make this thing work but I
     think we should take it slow.

 This ain't a movie naw
 No fairy tale conclusion ya'll
 It gets more confusing every day.
  
 Sometimes it's heaven sent
 Then we, head back to hell again
 We kiss, then we make up all the way.
  
 I hang up, you call
 We rise and we fall
 And we feel like just like walking away.
  
 As our love advances
 We take second chances
 Though it's not a fantasy
 I still want you to stay...

      I'm looking to the sky to save me
 Looking for a sign of life
 Looking for something to help me burn out bright
 I'm looking for a complication
 Looking 'cause I'm tired of lying
 Make my way back home and learn to fly
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Verse]
 Think I'm done nursing the patience,
 It could wait one night.
 Give it all away if you give me one last try
 We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life.
 Run and tell the angels that everything's alright.
  
 [Chorus]
      I'm looking to the sky to save me,
 Looking for a sign of life.
 Looking for something to help me burnout bright.
      I'm looking for a complication,
 Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying.
 Make my way back home when I learn to fly.
 Make my way back home when I learn to fly....

 Try to make this life my own.
 Fly.....along with me I can't quite make it alone.

 [Verse]
 I know that it is freezing but I think we have to walk
        Keep waving at the taxis, they keep turning their lights off
       But Julie knows a party at some actor's west-side loft
                Supplies are endless in the evening, by the morning, they'll be gone
  
       When everything is lonely, I can be my own best friend
           I get a coffee and the paper, have my own conversations
           With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
             The mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit
  
  
 [Chorus]
        And I know you have a heavy heart, I can feel it when we kiss
     So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out, trying to lift it
      But me, I'm not a gamble, you can count on me to split
             The love I sell you in the evening, by the morning, won't exist
  
  
 [Verse]
                 You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
            Just keep going to the bathroom always say you'll be right back
           Well it takes one to know one kid, I think you've got it bad
                But what's so easy in the evening, by the morning's such a drag
  
              I've got a flask inside my pocket, we can share it on the train
              And if you promise to stay conscious, I will try and do the same
                 Yeah we might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain
           What was normal in the evening, by the morning, seems insane
  
  
 [Chorus]
           And I'm not sure what the trouble was, that started all of this
        The reasons all have run away, but the feeling never did
       It's not something I would recommend but it is one way to live
                 'Cause what is simple in the moonlight, by the morning, never is
  
                Yeah it was simple in the moonlight, now it's so complicated
  
             It was so simple in the moonlight, so simple in the moonlight, so simple in

 Midnight you come and pick me up, no headlights 
 Long drive, could end in burnin' flames, or paradise

 Heard from you, heard from you

 I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
 Life is a maze and love is a riddle
 I don't know where to go, can't do it alone
 I've tried, and I don't know why.
 I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
 I'm so scared but I don't show it
 I can't figure it out, it's bringing me down
 I know I've got to let it go...
                      And just enjoy the show
  
  
 [Verse]
 The sun is hot in the sky
               Just like a giant spotlight
            The people follow the signs
       And synchronise in time
         It's a joke, nobody knows
                They've got a ticket to the show....
  
  
 [Chorus]
 I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
 Life is a maze and love is a riddle
 I don't know where to go, can't do it alone
 I've tried, and I don't know why.
 I'm just a little girl lost in the moment
 I'm so scared but I don't show it
 I can't figure it out, it's bringing me down

 Hey dad look at me
 Think back and talk to me
 Did I grow up according to plan?
 And do you think I'm wasting my time doing things I wanna do?
 But it hurts when you disapprove all along
 And now I try hard to make it
 I just want to make you proud
 I'm never gonna be good enough for you

 About the pain I feel inside
 Did you know you used to be my hero?
 All the days you spent with me now seem so far away
 And it feels like you don't care anymore
 And now I try hard to make it
 I just want to make you proud

       Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans,
 Way back up in the woods among the evergreens,
        There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
        Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
      Who never ever learned to read or write so well,
               But he could play the guitar just like a ringin' a bell.

       He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
 Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track.
        Old engineers would see him sittin' in the shade,
        Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made.
      When people passed him by they would stop and say,

 I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
                                          How we met and the sparks flew instantly
               People would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
 I used to know my place was a spot next to you
                                              Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
                             'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
  
  
 Oh, a simple complication
            Miscommunications lead to fall out
 So many things that I wish you knew
 So many walls that I can't break through
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
                        And we're not speaking
                   And I'm dying to know is it killing you
 ( Like it's killing me?
 I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
                    When it all broke down
          And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now-  Next chapter

 How'd we end up this way?
                   See me nervously pulling at my clothes
                         And trying to look busy
                        And you're doing your best to avoid me
  
 I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
                                              How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
                    But you held your pride like you should have held me
  
  
 Oh, we're scared to see the ending
             Why are we pretending this is nothing?
 I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how

 AND IN THE MORNING WHEN I RISE, YOU BRING A TEAR OF JOY TO MY EYES,
      AND TELL ME EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE ALRIGHT.
  
  
 [Verse]
 PISCES, VIRGO RISING IS A VERY GOOD SIGN, STRONG AND KIND,
                  AND THE LITTLE BOY IS MINE.
 NOW I SEE A FAMILY WHERE THERE ONCE WAS NONE, NOW WE'VE JUST BEGUN,
                     YEAH, WE'RE GONNA FLY TO THE SUN.
  
  
 [Chorus]
 AND EVEN THOUGH WE AIN'T GOT MONEY,  I'M SO IN LOVE WITH YA HONEY,
      AND EVERYTHING WILL BRING A CHAIN OF LOVE.
 AND IN THE MORNING WHEN I RISE, YOU BRING A TEAR OF JOY TO MY EYES,
      AND TELL ME EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE ALRIGHT.
  
  
 [Verse]
 LOVE THE GIRL WHO HOLDS THE WORLD IN A PAPER CUP, DRINK IT UP,
                        LOVE HER AND SHE'LL BRING YOU LUCK.
      AND IF YOU FIND SHE HELPS YOUR MIND, BUDDY, TAKE HER HOME,
             DON'T YOU LIVE ALONE, TRY TO EARN WHAT LOVERS OWN.

 Now you'll have to find out by yourself what rhythm do you want to play, for example in
 the intro bit you can only strum the chords once...but if you are playing by yourself
 like on an acoustic then it may not sound all that impressive...so what I do is play
 the chords,
     adding lil' dead notes before switching to the next chord, and I swear the rythm
 changes every time I play.
 So figure out the pattern you'll enjoy strumming for this song!
  
 Rhythm A :-
 Rhythm for the parts before the verses and in the verses...
  
 Intro: Play  higher e..going through one string at a time
 then play   
 Play the chorus part with the into rhythm
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Take me down to the paradise city
              Where the grass is green
   And the girls are pretty
 Oh, won't you please take me home
 Take me down to the paradise city
              Where the grass is green
 And the girls are pretty
 Oh, won't you please take me home
  
  
 Play: (Since no singing is required here you can strum the chords once)

 Just an urchin livin' under the street
 I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
      I'm your charity case
     So buy me somethin' to eat
 I'll pay you at another time
 Take it to the end of the line
  
 (Play Rhythm A)
  
 Rags to riches
 Or so they say
      You gotta
 Keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
 You know it's, it's all a gamble
 When it's just a game
 You treat it like a capitol crime
 Everybody' doin' their time
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Take me down to the paradise city
              Where the grass is green
 And the girls are pretty
 Oh, won't you please take me home
 Take me down to the paradise city
              Where the grass is green
     And the girls are pretty
 Oh, won't you please take me home

 Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
 Why I'm here, I can't quite remember
 The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe
 I'd have another cigarette
 But I can't see

 Take me down to the paradise city

 And the girls are pretty
 Oh, won't you please take me home
 Take me down to the paradise city
              Where the grass is green
    And the girls are pretty
 Oh, won't you please take me home

 Captain America's been torn apart
 Now he's a court jester
 With a broken heart
 He said turn me around
      And take me back to the start
   I must be losing my mind
           ""Are you blind?!""
       I've seen it all a million times
  
 Take me down to the paradise city
              Where the grass is green
 And the girls are pretty
 Oh, won't you please take me home
  
 Take me down to the paradise city
              Where the grass is green

 [Verse 1]
    I heard you crying loud
   all the way across town
               You've been searching for that someone
           and it's me out on the prowl
      As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
  
   Well, don't get lonely now
   And dry your whining eyes
           I'm just roaming for the moment
           Sleazin' my back yard so don't get
 so uptight you been thinking about ditching me

     No time to search the world around.
     Cause you know where I'll be found

 [Verse 2]
   I heard it all before
   So don't knock down my door
         I'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser
      to try and slag me down because I know you're right
   So go do what you like
   Make sure you do it wise
           You may find out that your self doubt
          means nothing was ever there
       You can't go forcing something
           if it's just not right

       Shadows Grow So Long Before My Eyes, And They're Moving, Across The Page

     Moon Appears To Shine, And Light The Sky, With The Help, Of Some Firefly
     Wonder How They Have, The Power To Shine, Shine, Shine

 [Verse]
  
 A blinding flash of white light
              Lit up the sky over Gaza tonight
     People running for cover
                   Not knowing whether they’re dead or alive
  
    They came with their tanks and their planes
    With ravaging fiery flames
    And nothing remains
          Just a voice rising up in the smoky haze
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
          We will not go down
          In the night, without a fight
           You can burn up our mosques and our homes and our schools
          But our spirit will never die
          We will not go down
             In Gaza tonight
  
  
 [Verse]
  
    Women and children alike
                   Murdered and massacred night after night
               While the so-called leaders of countries afar
     Debated on who’s wrong or right
  
   But their powerless words were in vain
   And the bombs fell down like acid rain
   But through the tears and the blood and the pain
           You can still hear that voice through the smoky haze
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
          We will not go down
          In the night, without a fight
          You can burn up our mosques and our homes and our schools

 [Verse 1]
  
    I remembered black skies
      The lightning all around me
      I remembered each flash
     As time began to blur
         Like a startling sign 
       That fate had finally found me
           And your voice was all I heard
         That I get what I deserve

     To prove me wrong

          Give me reason
     To fill this hole
     Connect the space between
         Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
   Across this new divide
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
            There was nothing in sight
      But memories left abandoned
            There was nowhere to hide
      The ashes fell like snow
          And the ground caved in
    Between where we were standing
           And your voice was all I heard
         That I get what I deserve

           In every truth that you deny

           Was a mistake too great to hide

 Most of the C chords here can be played as C7, too. The 7th is there somewhere in the
 Beatles' recording, but when played without a band with one guitar only, it might be
 a little too much. Some of the comments here suggest to play the 7th chords as barree
 rather than their open versions. Might be a solution. It's probably a matter of taste,
 whether to put it in or leave it out.

 When somebody loved me
 everything was beautiful
 every hour we spent together
 lives within my heart

 And when she was sad
 I was there to dry her tears
 and when she was happy so was I
       when she loved me

 Through the summer and the fall
      we had each other that was all
      just she and I together
       like it was meant to be
 and when she was lonely
 I was there to comfort her
        and I knew that she loved me
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 So the years went by
     I stayed the same
     but she began to drift away
 I was left alone
 still I waited for the day
  
 when she'd say
 I will always love you
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 Lonely and forgotten
 never thought she'd look my way
 and she smiled at me and held me
 just like she used to do

 Not sure if you know this

                    I’ve got an angel
    She doesn’t wear any wings
    She wears a heart that can melt my own
                    She wears a smile that can make me wanna sing
                     She gives me presents
    With her presence alone
    She gives me everything I could wish for
                     She gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
                       She could make angels
    I’ve seen it with my own eyes
    You gotta be careful when you've got good love
                  Cause the angels will just keep on multiplying
  
            But you’re so busy changing the world

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse]
          When life leaves you high and dry
  I'll be at your door tonight
      If you need help, if you need help
         I'll shut down the city lights
  
  I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe
      To make you well, to make you well
  
         When enemies are at your door 
  I'll carry you way from more
      If you need help, if you need help
         Your hope dangling by a string
  
  I'll share in your suffering
       To make you well, to make you well

           Give me reasons to believe 
                 That you would do the same for me

 [Verse]
 You were in college working part time waiting tables
          Left a small town, never looked back
 I was a flight risk with the fear of fallin'
 Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 I say can you believe it?
 As we're lying on a couch
    The moment I can see it
 Yes, yes I can see it now
  
  
 [Chorus]
 Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
 You put your arm around me for the first time
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
 You are the best thing that's ever been mine
  
  
  
 [Verse]
 Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
 And there is a drawer of my things and your place
 You learned my secrets and you figured out why I'm guarded
 You said we'll never make my parents' mistakes
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
 But we've got bills to pay
 We've got nothing figured out
 When it was hard to take yes, yes
 This is what I thought about
  
  
 [Chorus]
 Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
 You put your arm around me for the first time
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
 You are the best thing that's ever been mine
 Do you remember all the city lights on the water
 You saw me start to believe for the first time
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
 You are the best thing that's ever been mine
  
  
  
 [Bridge]
 And I remember that fight 2:30am
        Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""Em7"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Em7</span> And I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
  
 <span class=""_3PpPJ OrSDI"" data-name=""Em7"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Em7</span> Braced myself for the goodbye
 Cause that's all I've ever known
 And you took me by surprise
 You said I'll never leave you alone
  
  
 [Chorus]

 And every time I look at you it's like the first time
 I fell in love with careless man's careful daughter

   I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
  
   Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
 Then you come crashing in
           Like the realest thing
 Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

 Showing me a better way and all that my love can bring

 [Verse 1:]
   How can I decide what’s right
   when you’re clouding up my mind
 I can’t win your losing
 fight all the time
   How can I ever own what’s mine
   when you’re always taking sides
 But you won’t take away
     my pride no not this time
           Not this time

 [Verse 1]
 Me and all my friends, we're all misunderstood.
        They say we stand for nothing, and theres no way we ever could.
                 Now we see everything that's going wrong with the world and those who lead it
           We just feel like we don't have the means to rise above and beat it.
  
  
 [Chorus]
                So we keep waiting, (waiting) waiting on the world to change.
                We keep on waiting, (waiting) waiting on the world to change.
         It's hard to beat the system, when you're standing at a distance,
                So we keep waiting, (waiting) waiting on the world to change.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 Now if we had the power to bring our neighbors home from war 
        They would have never missed a Christmas, no more ribbons on their door
                 And when you trust your television, what you get is what you got 
           Cause when they own the information, oh they can bend it all they want 
  
  
 [Chorus]
                That's why we're waiting (waiting) waiting on the world to change 
                We keep on waiting (waiting) waiting on the world to change 
         It's not that we don't care, we just know that the fight ain't fair 
                So we keep on waiting (waiting) waiting on the world to change

 [Intro]
  
 Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck.
 Some nights I call it a draw.
 Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle.
 Some nights I wish they'd just fall off
  
         But I still wake up, I still see your ghost.
                 Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh.
 What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
 Most nights, I don't know anymore
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 This is it, boys. This is war.
 What are we waiting for?
 Why don't we break the rules already?
         I was never one to believe the hype.
 Save that for the black and white.
         I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked,
       But here they come again to jack my style
                 And that's alright
              I found a martyr in my bed tonight.
      She stops my bones from wondering
       Just who I am, who I am, who I am.
           Yeah, oh who am I    mmmm   mmmmm
  
  
 [Hook]
  
 Some nights I wish that this all would end
          'Cause I could use some friends for a change.
       And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again.
        Some nights, I always win (I always win)
         But I still wake up, I still see your ghost.
             Oh Lord, I still don't know what I stand for, oh.
        What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
 Most nights, I don't know
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 So this is it? I sold my soul for this?
 Washed my hands of that for this?
 I miss my mom and dad for this?
 No. When I see stars, when i see stars, that's all they are.
           When I hear songs, they sound like a swan.
           So come on. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Oh, come on!
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 That is it, guys, that is all.
 Five minutes in and I'm bored again.
 Ten years of this, and I'm not sure if anybody understands.
 This is not one for the folks back home.
 I'm sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go.
 Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
               My heart is breaking for my sister
           And the con that she called love.
              But when I look into my nephew's eyes,
 Man, you wouldn't believe
 The most amazing things that can come from.
                   Some terrible nights.
  
  
  
 [Outro]
  
 The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
 I called you up, but we'd both agree
 It's for the best you didn't listen
 It's for the best we get our distance.

 [Verse]
  
 Sitting on my own, chewing on a bone
    a thousand million miles from home, when
 something      hit me,  somewhere right between the eyes
  
 Sleeping on a plane you know you can't complain
    You took your last chance once again, and
 landed, stranded, hardly even knew your name
  
  
 [Chorus]

 during each G  Dsus4  Em7*  part of the chorus.
 [NOTE: this is almost the exact same riff as can be found in the ""And all

 [Verse]
  
 All your dreams are made of strawberry lemonade
    and you make sure I eat today, you
 take me      walking to where you played when you were young
  
 I'll never say that I won't ever make you cry

 That's pretty much it, except towards the end of the song, there are 2
 changes to the usual patterns.
  
 1) Towards the end, the ""And you and me see how we are"" part goes
  
          and you and me see how we are
                          you and me see how we are
  
 2) At the end where the chorus is repeating again and again, it starts to
 go like this every 4 measures:

 Catching teardrops in my hand

 Can't stop addicted to the shindig 
 Chop top he says I'm gonna win big 
 Choose not a life of imitation 
 Distant cousin to the reservation 
 Defunct the pistol that you pay for 
 This punk the feeling that you stay for 
 In time I want to be your best friend 
 Eastside love is living on the westend 
 Knocked out but boy you better come to 
 Don't die you know the truth as some do 
 Go write your message on the pavement 
 Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant 
 White heat is screaming in the jungle 
 Complete the motion if you stumble 
 Go ask the dust for any answers 
 Come back strong with 50 belly dancers 
  
 [Chorus]
       The world I love 
       The tears I've dropped 
     To be part of 
       the wave can't stop 
 Ever wonder if it's all for you
       The world I love 
        The trains I hop 
     To be part of 
       The wave can't stop 
   Come and tell me when it's time to

 Sweetheart is bleeding in the snowcone 
 So smart she's leading me to ozone 
 Music the great communicator 
 Use two sticks to make it in the nature 
 I'll get you into penetration 
 The gender of a generation 
 The birth of every other nation 
 Worth your weight the gold of meditation 
 This chapter's going to be a close one 
 Smoke rings I know you're going to blow one 
 All on a spaceship persevering 
 Use my hands for everything but steering 
 Can't stop the spirits when they need you 
 Mop tops are happy when they feed you 
 Jay butterfly is in the treetop 
 Birds that blow the meaning into bebop
  
 [Chorus]
       The world I love 
       The tears I've dropped 
     To be part of

       The world I love 
        The trains I hop

       The wave can't stop 
   Come and tell me when it's time to

 Wait a minute I'm passing out, win or lose, just like you 
 Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew, how 'bout you 
 Ten more reasons why I need somebody new, just like you 
 Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew, right on cue

 Sweet talk but don't intimidate her

 Feel no need for any interfering

 Tabbed by : Dgonz
 Tuning: Eb
  
 ganda ng kantang to! kaya inisipan kong i tab to. kaya... eto.
  
  
 [Verse]
  
  Minsan sa may Kalayaan tayo'y nagkatagpuan
    May mga sariling gimik at kanya-kanyang hangad sa buhay
  Sa ilalim ng iisang bubong, mga sikretong ibinubulong
    Kahit na ano'ng mangyari, kahit na saan ka man patungo.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
              Ngunit ngayon kay bilis maglaho ng kahapon
    Sana'y wag kalimutan ang ating mga pinagsamahan
       At kung sakaling   gipitin ay     laging iisipin
        Na minsan tayo ay naging tunay na    magkaibigan.

 [Verse]
  
  Minsan ay parang wala nang bukas sa buhay natin
    Inuman hanggang sa magdamag na para bang tayo'y mauubusan
  Sa ilalim ng bilog na buwan, mga tiyan nati'y walang laman
    Ngunit kahit na walang pera, ang bawat gabi'y anong saya.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
              Ngunit ngayon kay bilis maglaho ng kahapon
    Sana'y wag kalimutan ang ating mga pinagsamahan

     Minsan ay hindi mo na alam ang nangyayari
          Kahit na  ano'ng gawin, lahat ng bagay ay mayrong hangganan
             Dahil ngayon tayo ay nilimot ng kahapon
    Di na mapipilit na buhayin ang ating pinagsamahan
           Ngunit kung sakaling mapadaan, baka     ikaw ay aking tawagan
           Dahil minsan tayo ay naging tunay na     magkaibigan.

 [Intro]
                             You know I like my chicken fried, cold beer on a friday night
                       A pair of jeans that fit just right and the radio up
  
  
 [Verse 1]
             Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a georgia pine and that's home 
 you know
 Sweet tea, pecan pie and home made wine where the peaches grow
 And my house it's not much to talk about
           But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
  
 [Chorus]
                              And a little bit of chicken fried, cold beer on a friday night
                        A pair of jeans that fit just right and the radio up
                     I like to seen the sun rise, see the love in my woman's eyes
                         Feel the touch of a precious child, and know a mother's love
  
 [Verse 2]
           Well its funny how it`s the little things in life that mean the most 
      Not where you live or what you drive or the price tag on your clothes 
              There`s no dollar sign on a piece of mind this I`ve come to know 
         So if you agree have a drink with me, raise you glasses for a toast
  
 [Chorus]
                              To a little bit of chicken fried , cold beer on a friday night

                       I like to seen the sun rise, see the love in my woman's eyes

 [Verse 3]
              I thank god for my life 
               And for the stars and stripes 
                 May freedom forever fly, let it ring. 
             Salute the ones who died 
                 The ones that give their lives so we don`t have to sacrifice 
                     All the things we love

 Capo 2
  
  
 [Intro]
  
 Ooohh New York x2
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 Grew up in a town that is famous as the place of movie scenes
 Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
 If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
 Seeing my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway
  
  
 [Pre-chorus]
  
 Even if it ain’t all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                 Baby, I'm from New York
                                        Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
                      There's nothing you can't do
                 Now you're in New York
                                    These streets will make you feel brand new
                      Big lights will inspire you
                         Let's hear it for New York, New York, New Yoooork!
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
 Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God
 Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
 Some will sleep tonight with a hunger for more than an empty fridge
  
  
 [Pre-chorus]
  
 I'm gonna make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                     Baby, I'm from New York
                                          Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
                      There's nothing you can't do
                     Now you're in New York
                                          These street will make you feel brand new

                        Let's hear it for New York, New York, New Yoooork!
  
 One hand in the air for the big city,
                                               Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty
                                          No place in the world that can com-pare
                            Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
         In New York
                                          Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
                      There's nothing you can't do

0,I Hate U I Love U chords,I Hate U I Love U – gnash,"[Verse 1]
  
 Feeling used
 But I'm
 Still missing you
 And I can't
  
 See the end of this
              Just wanna feel your kiss
 Against my lips
          And now all this time
 Is passing by
         But I still can't seem to tell you why
     It hurts me every time I see you
    Realise how much I need you
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
    I hate you I love you
     I hate that I love you
        Don't want to, but I can't put
 Nobody else above you
    I hate you I love you
     I hate that I want you
      You want her, you need her
       And I'll never be her
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 I miss you when I can't sleep
      Or right after coffee
 Or right when I can't eat
    I miss you in my front seat
             Still got sand in my sweaters
 From nights we don't remember
 Do you miss me like I miss you?
 Fucked around and got attached to you
 Friends can break your heart too, and
       I'm always tired but never of you
 If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
 I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
 I type a text but then I never mind that shit
 I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
 Oh oh, keep it on the low
 You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
 If you wanted me you would just say so
 And if I were you, I would never let me go
  
 [Chorus]
  
    I hate you I love you
     I hate that I love you
        Don't want to, but I can't put
 Nobody else above you
    I hate you I love you
     I hate that I want you
      You want her, you need her
       And I'll never be her
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 I don't mean no harm
          I just miss you on my arms
          Wedding bells were just alarms
           Caution tape around my heart
 You ever wonder what we coulda been?
 You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
 Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
 Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
 Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
            Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
          I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
          But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
 When love and trust are gone
           I guess this is moving on
 Everyone I do right does me wrong
      So every lonely night, I sing this song
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
    I hate you I love you
     I hate that I love you
        Don't want to, but I can't put
 Nobody else above you
    I hate you I love you
     I hate that I want you
      You want her, you need her
       And I'll never be her
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
 All alone I watch you watch her
                  Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
 You don't care u never did
      You don't give a damn about me
       Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
            She's the only thing you've ever seen
 How is it you never notice
       That you are slowly killing me
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
    I hate you I love you
     I hate that I love you
        Don't want to, but I can't put
 Nobody else above you
    I hate you I love you
     I hate that I want you
      You want her, you need her
       And I'll never be her

                    I took a pill in Ibiza
           To show Avicii I was cool
             And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
      But fuck it, it was something to do
                    I'm living out in LA
            I drive a sports car just to prove
        I'm a real big baller cause I made a million dollar
        And I spend it on girls and shoes

                     And I can't keep a girl, no

 When I had you to myself
    I didn't want you around
        Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
      But someone picked you from the bunch
      One glance was all it took

 Tryin' to live without your love

 Let me show you girl
       That I know wrong from right
 Every street you walk on
    I leave tearstains on the ground
 Following the girl
           I didn't even want around, let me tell you now
  
  
 [Chorus]
 Oh baby, all I need is one more chance (show you that I love you)

              I'm a little bit rusty, and I think my head is caving in
      And I don't know if I've ever been really loved...

 [Verse]
   Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
             Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
                 Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst
                         Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
  
 Let us stay young or let us live forever
             We don't have the power, but we never say never
                 Sitting in the sandpit, life is a short trip
                          The music's for the sad man
  
 Can you imagine when this race is won
             Turn our golden faces into the sun
                 Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
                         The music's played by the mad man
  
 [Chorus]

            I want to be Forever Young
  Do you really want to live forever?
  Forever, and ever
   Forever Young,
            I want to be Forever Young
 Do you really want to live forever?
      Forever Young.
  
 [Verse]
 Some are like water, some are like the heat
             Some are the melody and some are the beat
                 Sooner or later they all will be gone
                         Why don't they stay young?
  
 It's so hard to get old without a cause
             I don't want to perish like a fading horse
                   Youth's like diamonds in the sun
                         And diamonds are forever
  
 So many adventures given up today
             So many songs we forgot to play
                 So many dreams swinging out of the blue
                         Oh let it come true
  
 [Chorus]
   Forever Young
            I want to be Forever Young
  Do you really want to live forever?
  Forever, and ever
   Forever Young,
            I want to be Forever Young
 Do you really want to live forever?
      Forever Young.

 Do you really want to live forever?
      Forever Young.

             An old man said to me, won't see another one  And then he sang a song
                'The Rare Old Mountain Dew' And I turned my face away
      And dreamed about    you
  
 [Slow Verse]
            Got on a lucky one, came in eighteen to one

 [Verse 1]
 Blue jean baby,  L.A. lady,  seamstress for the band
 Pretty eyed, pirate smile,  you'll marry a music man
 Ballerina,  you must have seen her,   dancing in the sand
 Now she's in me,  always with me,  tiny dancer in my hand
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 Jesus freaks,  out in the street,  handing tickets out for God
 Turning back,  she just laughs,  the boulevard is not that bad
 Piano man,  he makes his stand,  in the auditorium
 Looking on,  she sings the songs,  the words she knows, the tune she hums
  
  
 [Bridge]
   But oh how it feels so real
 Lying here, with no one near
 Where only you, and you can hear me
               When I say, ""Softly...""
   ""Slowly...""

 [Verse 1]
   It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart,
   without saying a word you can light up the dark.
 Try as I may I could never explain
   what I hear when you don't say a thing.
  
 [Chorus]
      The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.
            There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.
      The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall.
 You say it best,   when you say nothing at [Instrumental] all.

 I saw some horrible attempts at this tune, which actually isn't that difficult... it's
 about 5 chords.  Listen to the record and you'll get the timing, but watch out for the
 F# half-diminished in the bridge... it's pretty cool.

 [Verse 1]
  
           Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
      I'm leavin' my life in your hands
 People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
 Risking it all in a glance
      And how you got me blind is still a mystery
    I can't get you out of my head
 Don't care what is written in your history
       As long as you're here with me
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
  
               I don't care who you are

 [Verse 2]
  
           Every little thing that you have said and done
      Feels like it's deep within me
 Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
 It seems like we're meant to be

    Longing just to bring, something that's of worth

 [Verse 1]
  
 Tonight we drink to youth
      and holding fast the truth
         don't want to lose what i had as a boy
 my heart still has a beat
        but love is now a feat
       as common as a cold day in L.A.

      sometimes when I'm alone I wonder
 is there a spell that I am under
 keeping me from seeing the real thing

 Love hurts
          but sometimes it's a good hurt
           and it feels like I'm alive
 Love sings
        when it transcends the bad things
           have a heart and try me
           cause without love I won't survive

 I only want the truth
          so tonight we drink to youth
     I never lose what I had as a boy

 [Verse 1]
  
 White lips, pale face,
             Breathing in snowflakes,
         Burnt lungs, sour taste.
 Light's gone, day's end,
                Struggling to pay rent,
            Long nights, strange men.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And they say she's in the Class A Team,
                  Stuck in her daydream,
                      Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems
                    Slowly sinking, wasting,
                  Crumbling like pastries,
  
 And they scream,
 The worst things in life come free to us,
             Cos we're just under the upperhand,
 And go mad for a couple grams,
 And she don't want to go outside tonight,
         And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland,
      Or sells love to another man,
 It's too cold outside,
 For angels to fly,
 Angels to fly,
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Ripped gloves, raincoat,
                             Tried to swim and stay afloat,
           Dry house, wet clothes.
  
 Loose change, bank notes,
                      Weary-eyed, dry throat,
          Call girl, no phone.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And they say she's in the Class A Team,
                  Stuck in her daydream,

 It's too cold outside,
 For angels to fly,
 Angels to fly,
 An angel will die.

 Covered in white,
 Closed eye,
       And hoping for a better life,
 This time, we'll fade out tonight,
 Straight down the line.

 [Verse 1]
    Have you got colour in your cheeks?
                                           Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
                          That sticks around like summat in your teeth
                 Are there some aces up your sleeve
                                  Have you no idea that you're in deep
                            I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
           How many secrets can you keep?
                                       Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow
         When I play it on repeat
    Until I fall asleep
                        Spilling drinks on my settee

           (Baby we both know)
            That the nights were mainly made
             for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

                                Well baby I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
                       Now I've thought it through
                    Crawling back to you
  
 [Verse 2]
    So have you got the guts?
                                       Been wondering if your heart's still open and
                if so I wanna know what time it shuts
    Simmer down and pucker up
                              I'm sorry to interrupt it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you
    but I don't know if you feel the same as I do

 [Verse 2]
              And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
               Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
                 That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing
               He bled and died to take away my sin

 [Verse 3]
                    When Christ shall come, with shouts of acclamation
              And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
                Then I shall bow in humble adoration
               And there proclaim, My God, how great You are!

          Oh, the weather outside is frightful,    
          But the fire is so   delightful,

         Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

 Don't be discouraged
    Oh, I realize
       It's hard to take courage
       In a world full of people
 You can lose sight of it all
      The darkness inside you

 Okay, here's my try on 74-75 by The Connells. Only some changes, but I guess
 they make it easier to play the song. The song was originally posted by

 Send in your skeletons

 Are you ready?

 [Verse]
        Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
    I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
    I fell right through the cracks,
          Now I'm tryin' to get back
             Before the cool done run out I'll be givin' it my bestest
      And nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
    I reckon it's again my turn
     To win some or learn some
  
 [Chorus]
      But I won't hesitate
              No more, no more
            It cannot wait, I'm yours

  Well, open up your mind and see like me
                                     Open up your plans and damn you're free
  
 Look into your heart and you'll find
 Love love love love
 Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
                          We're just one big family
                                       And it's our godforsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved
  
 [Chorus]
      So, I won't hesitate
              No more, no more,
            It cannot wait I'm sure
             There's no need to complicate our time is short

                             but do you want to come on?
                 Scooch on over closer, dear
                          And I will nibble your ear
                       A-soo da ba ba ba ba bum
       Whoa oh, oh oh oh oh oh

 [Verse]
                     I've been spendin' way too long checkin' my tongue in the mirror
      and bendin' over backwards just to try to see it clearer
      But my breath fogged up the glass
           And so I drew a new face and I laughed
    I guess what I'd be sayin' is there ain't no better reason
     To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
 It's what we aim to do
      Our name is our virtue
  
 [Chorus]

                                               I look into your heart and you will find that the sky is yours
     So please don't, please don't, please don't,
             There's no need to complicate,
             Cause our time is short

 Shorty get down, good Lord
 Baby got 'em up open all over town
 Strictly biz, she don't play around
 Cover much ground, got game by the pound
 Getting paid is a forte
 Each and every day, true player way
 I can't get her out of my mind (say what)
 I think about the girl all the time (well, well)
 East side to the west side
          Pushing phat rides, ain't no surprise
 She got tricks in the stash
                   Stacking up the cash
                Quick when it comes to the gas
 By no means average
         She's on when she's got to have it
 Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
            Can I get down, so I can win

 In balance by the pound,
 Shorty never act wild
 Very low key on the profile
 Catching feelings is a no,
 Let me tell you how it goes
 Curves the words, spins the verbs
 Lovin' it curves so freak what you heard
 Rollin' with the phatness
 You don't quite know what the half is
 You got to pay to play
 Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
 I like the way you work it
 Top notch, trumped tight, every day
           You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
 Baby, I can get you in my ride

 I've been cheated by you, since I don't know when
 So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
 Look at me now, will I ever learn?
 I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
                     There's a fire within my soul

 Just one  look and I can hear a bell ring
 One more look and I forget everything

 Mamma mia, here I go again
 My  my, how can I resist you?
 Mamma mia, does it show again?
 My  my, just how much I've missed you
  
 Yes, I've been brokenhearted
 Blue since the day we parted
 Why, why did I ever let you go?
 Mamma mia, now I really know,
 My   my, I could never let you go

 [Verse 2]
 I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
 I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
 And when you go, when you slam the door
 I think you know, that you won't be away too long
                    You know that I'm not that strong

 Bye bye, leave me now or never
 mamma mia, it's a game we play
 Bye bye doesn't mean forever
  
 Mamma mia, here I go again
 My  my, how can I resist you?
 Mamma mia, does it show again?

 [Verse 1]
 Woke up cold one tuesday,
 i'm looking tired and feeling quite sick, 
 i felt like there was something missing in my day to day life, 
       so i quickly opened the wardrobe, 
 pulled out some jeans and a T-Shirt that seemed clean, 
 topped it off with a pair of old shoes, 
            that were ripped around the seams,
                and i thought these shoes just don't suit me. 
  
 [Chorus]
 Hey, I put some new shoes on, 
      and suddenly everything is right,
          I said, hey, I put some new shoes on 
      and everybody's smiling, its so inviting, 
      Oh, short on money, but long on time,
 slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine,
      and i'm running late,
             and i dont need an excuse,
             'cause i'm wearing my brand new shoes.
  
 [Verse 2]
 Woke up late one thursday,
 i'm seeing stars as i'm rubbing my eyes, 
        and i felt like there were two days missing, 
        as i focused on the time,
        and i made my way to the kitchen,
 but i had to stop from the shock of what i found,
 a room full of all my friends dancing round and round,
                and i thought hello new shoes, byebye blues. 
  
 [Chorus]
 Hey, I put some new shoes on, 
      and suddenly everything is right,
          I said, hey, I put some new shoes on 
      and everybody's smiling, its so inviting, 
      Oh, short on money, but long on time,
 slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine,
      and i'm running late,
             and i dont need an excuse,
             'cause i'm wearing my brand new shoes.
  
 [Breakdown]
 Take me wondering through these streets, 
 where bright lights and angels meet, 
 stone to stone they take me on,  
     im walking to the break of dawn.

              I like your eyes, you look away when you pretend not to care
             I like the dimples on the corners of the smile that you wear
             I like you more, the world may know but don't be scared
          Coz I'm falling deeper, baby be prepared
  
              I like your shirt, I like your fingers, love the way that you smell
             to be your favorite jacket, just so I could always be near
              I loved you for so long, sometimes it's hard to bear
            But after all this time, I hope you wait and see

 Love you every minute, every second
 Love you everywhere and any moment
 Always and forever I know I can't quit you 'cause
 Baby you're the one, I don't know how
 Love you til the last of snow disappears
 Love you til a rainy day becomes clear
 Never knew a love like this, now I can't let go
 I'm in love with you, and now you know

             I like the way you try so hard when you play ball with your friends,

              I catch you steal a glance and smile so perfectly

 Though sometimes when life brings me down
 You're the cure my love
       In a bad rainy day
      You take all the worries away

 Love you every minute, every second
 Love you everywhere and any moment
 Always and forever I know I can't quit you 'cause
 Baby you're the one, I don't know how
 In a world devoid of life, you bring color
 In your eyes I see the light, my future
 Always and forever I know, I can't let you go
 I'm in love with you, and now you know

 A Hard Day's Night
 (Lennon/McCartney)
  
 From ""A Hard Day's Night"" (1964)
  
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 EDIT April 2015
 Went through the comments section and tried to update this tab using the corrections there
 as it is one of the versions on UG that are visited frequently.
 Some of the voicings are really  difficult to identify. There are several guitar tracks
 some of which might use differing voicings (maybe a 12-string, too?). Some options are
 suggested below. Choose whatever sounds good to you. Moreover, there is a special suggestion
 made by the original submitter of this tab. Sounds nice, even though it might not be
 what is played on the Beatles' recording.
  
 EDIT May 2018
 Opening chord Harrison arguably played an Fadd9 here. Playing alone on a single 6-string guitar,
 however, there is no ""correct"" way to play the opening chord. What is heard on the Beatles'
 recording is a blend of 6- and 12-string guitars, bass and piano(s ?). In order to recreate the
 effect of this multi-layered sound impression, a G7sus4 is often suggested, which actually
 sounds close. But the ""a"" is missing here. Another option may be Fadd9, but then the bass plays
 ""d"", so maybe D7sus4 might be a good substitute, too (not enough bottom end, though, in my opinon).
 Experiment for yourself, play together with other guitarists and use different voicings in order to
 create the big ""Bang!"".
  
  
 CHORDS / SPECIAL VOICINGS
  
 Opening Chord
              E-A-D-G-B-e
 G7sus4/D     x-5-3-5-3-3  or  x-x-0-0-1-1
 D7sus4       x-x-0-2-1-3 (actually Fadd9/D)
 D7sus4/A     x-0-0-0-1-3 or x-0-0-2-1-3 (more bottom end than the regular D7sus4)
 Fadd9        x-x-3-2-1-3 or 1-0-3-2-1-3 or 1-3-3-0-1-1 (on a 12-string this voicing
                                                         would include the high f AND g notes)
 F6add9/A     x-0-3-5-3-3
 F6add9/C     x-3-3-2-3-3
 (==> all voicings of Fadd9 or F6add9 miss out on the ""d"" in the bass, though) 
  
 Another opening chord idea (using a different tuning)
              D-G-D-G-B-e
 Fadd9/D      0-0-3-2-1-3  
  
 Song
              E-A-D-G-B-e
 Keep your pinky on the third fret of the high e-string for the first two lines of the verses
 for the G, C, and F chords
 G            3-x-0-0-3-3
 C            x-3-2-0-1-3
 F            x-x-3-2-1-3 or 1-x-3-2-1-3 (actually Fadd9) 
  
 D            x-x-0-2-3-2
 Bm           x-2-4-4-3-2
 Em           0-2-2-0-0-0
 C6           x-3-2-2-1-0
 D7sus4       x-x-0-2-1-3 (actually  Fadd9/D)
 Dm7          x-x-0-2-1-1 (actually  F/D)
  
  
 Another possibility which gives a special flavour in the verses is G - Cadd9 - F6add9.
 This is very easy to play Leave your pinkie and ring finger down, and it's easy.
 G            3-x-0-0-3-3
 Cadd9        x-3-2-0-3-3
 F6add9       x-x-3-2-3-3

  I was listening to the ocean
 I saw a face in the sand
             But when I picked it up
           Then it vanished away from my hands
 I had a dream I was seven
 Climbing my way in a tree
          I saw a piece of heaven
 Waiting impatient for me
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
      And I was running far away
        Would I run off the world someday?
 Nobody knows, nobody knows
     And I was dancing in the rain
     I felt alive and I can't complain

 But now take me home
 Take me home where I belong
                      I can't take it anymore
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 I was painting a picture
 The picture was a painting of you and
        For a moment I thought you were here
             But then again, it wasn't true
      And all this time I have been lying
      Oh, lying in secret to myself
          I've been putting sorrow on the farrest place
          On my shelf, da di da
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
      And I was running far away
        Would I run off the world someday?
 Nobody knows, nobody knows
     And I was dancing in the rain
     I felt alive and I can't complain
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 But now take me home
 Take me home where I belong
  
 I got no other place to go
 Now take me home
 Take me home where I belong
  
 I got no other place to go
 Now take me home
 Take me home where I belong
                      I can't take it anymore

            But I kept running
                      For a soft place to fall
            And I kept running
                      For a soft place to fall
            And I kept running
                      For a soft place to fall
            And I kept running
                      For a soft place to fall

      And I was running far away
        Would I run off the world someday?

 But now take me home
 Take me home where I belong
  
 I got no other place to go
 Now take me home

 Transcribed in friendly G, ABBA's recording is in F#, however.
 To match the key of the recording:
 - transpose this chord sheet -1 to F# or
 - tune down the guitar on step to Eb-Ab-Db-G-Bb-Eb or
 - transpose this chord sheet -2 to F and use a capo 1st fret
 - transpose this chord sheet -5 to D and use a capo 4th fret (my preferred option)
  
 Novice players may leave out the slash chords (see voicings below) and just
 play the regular shapes (E7 instead of E7/G#, D instead of D/F#  etc.).

 [Verse]
                I don't wanna talk
                     About things we've gone through
                      Though it's hurting me
                Now it's history
  
                 I've played all my cards
                         And that's what you've done too
                  Nothing more to say
                 No more ace to play
  
  
 [Chorus]
                      The winner takes it all
      The loser standing small
    Beside the victory
                  That's her destiny
  
  
 [Verse]
                I was in your arms
               Thinking I belonged there
                    I figured it made sense
                Building me a fence
  
                Building me a home
                  Thinking I'd be strong there
              But I was a fool
                 Playing by the rules
  
  
 [Bridge]
                       The gods may throw a dice
        Their minds as cold as ice
      And someone way down here
                Loses someone dear
  
  
 [Chorus]
                      The winner takes it all
      The loser has to fall
       It's simple and it's plain
                  Why should I complain?
  
  
 [Verse]
             But tell me does she kiss
                 Like I used to kiss you?
                   Does it feel the same
                      When she calls your name?
  
                Somewhere deep inside
                  You must know I miss you
                 But what can I say
                 Rules must be obeyed
  
  
 [Bridge 2]
             The judges will decide
      The likes of me abide
      Spectators of the show
                 Always staying low
  
  
 [Bridge 3]
                  The game is on again
    A lover or a friend
    A big thing or a small
                      The winner takes it all
  
  
 [Verse]
                I don't wanna talk
                  If it makes you feel sad
              And I understand
                          You've come to shake my hand
  
         I apologize
                  If it makes you feel bad
               Seeing me so tense
               No self-confidence, but you see …Z
  
  
 [Outro]
  
                    |  The winner takes it all
    [  The winner takes it all ...
  
  So the winner takes it a -all
  And the loser has to fall
  Throw a di-ice, cold as ice
  Way down here, someone dear
  Takes it a-all, has to fall
  It seems plain to me ...

 All alone, smoking his last cigarette

       When everything was falling apart
         All my days were spent by the telephone
           It never rang
      And all I needed was a call

         To the corner of first and Amistad

 Drying up in conversation, you will be the one who cannot talk.
 All your insides fall to pieces. You just sit there wishing you could still make love.
  
 They're the ones who'll hate you when you think you've got the world all sussed out.
 They're the ones who'll spit at you. You will be the one screaming out.

  I hear the clock, it's six a.m.
  I feel so far from where I've been
  I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
       I've got my maple syrup, everything but you
  I break the yolks, and make a smiley face
  I kinda like it in my brand new place
           Wipe the spots off of the mirror, don't leave my keys in the door
    I never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   Dreams last so long
 Even after you're gone
   I know that you love me
      And soon you will see

      And I was meant for you

       More hearts being broken or people being used
  Put on my coat in the pouring rain
  I saw a movie, it just wasn't the same
        'Cause it was happy oh, I was sad and
  It made me miss you, oh so bad 'cause

 And if there is someone who thinks: ""Hey that is wrong!""
 Maybe you have heard version of Guns n' Roses. Because Dylan's and their version is different.
  
 To match Dylan's recording from the album ...

          Cause I speak of the pompitous of love
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 People talk about me, baby
 Say I'm doin' you wrong, doin' you wrong
 Well, don't you worry baby Don't worry
 Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
              Cause I'm a picker
         I'm a grinner
         I'm a lover
             And I'm a sinner
            I play my music in the sun
  
          I'm a joker
         I'm a smoker
         I'm a midnight toker
 I sure don't want to hurt no one
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 You're the cutest thing
   That I ever did see
 I really love your peaches
   Want to shake your tree
 Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time
 Ooo-eee baby, I'll sure show you a good time
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
              Cause I'm a picker
         I'm a grinner
         I'm a lover
             And I'm a sinner
            I play my music in the sun
  
          I'm a joker
         I'm a smoker
         I'm a midnight toker
 I sure don't want to hurt no one
  
              Cause I'm a picker
         I'm a grinner
         I'm a lover
             And I'm a sinner
            I play my music in the sun
  
          I'm a joker
         I'm a smoker
         I'm a midnight toker
 I sure don't want to hurt no one
  
 Wooo Woooo
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 People keep talking about me baby
 They say I'm doin' you wrong
 Well don't you worry, don't worry, no don't worry mama
 Cause I'm right here at home
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 You're the cutest thing I ever did see
 Really love your peaches want to shake your tree
 Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time
 Come on baby and I'll show you a good time

 I'm staring out into the night,
 Trying to hide the pain.
 I'm going to the place where love
      And feeling good don't ever cost a thing.
          And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain.
  
 [Chorus]
 Well I'm going home,
             Back to the place where I belong,

 I'm not running from.
      No, I think you got me all wrong.
 I don't regret this life I chose for me.

 You always seem to give me another try.

                       Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm 
      Says it was poison
  
                  So I guess I go home into the arms of the girl that I love
                  The only love I haven't screwed up
                   She's so hard to please but she's a forest fire
  
          I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance, we slow dance in the living room
      But all that a stranger would see
         Is one girl swaying alone stroking her cheek

  Never knowing when to stop
  
  Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
 Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
    Cages and poles
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
  Call off the search for your soul
               Or put it on hold again
                             She's having a sly indoor smoke
                    And she calls the folks who run this her oldest friends
  
  Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
                As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
                  And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
                That you just swallowed have got you going
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   Come on, come on, come on
       Come on, come on, come on
          Number one party anthem
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
  She's a certified mind blower
  Knowing full well that I don't
  May suggest there's somewhere from which you might know her
  Just to get the ball to roll
  
  Drunken monologues, confused because
       It's not like I'm falling in love
                     I just want you to do me no good
          And you look like you could
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   Come on, come on, come on
       Come on, come on, come on
          Number one party anthem
  
       Come on, come on, come on
    Before the moment's gone
          Number one party anthem
       Yeah, yeah

  The look of love - the rush of blood
                                   The ""She's with me"" - the Gallic shrug
             The shutterbugs - the Camera Plus

 Try strumming the lower notes more predominantly to get the real bassy sound
 Justin has. Might not be 100% correct so feel free to add corretions/suggestions.
 The G might be a standard G but I never really play the higher strings when I play
 it anyway. Cheers.
  
  
 [Verse]
  
         Well I met you at the blood bank
          We were looking at the bags
            Wondering if any of the colors
                     Matched any of the names we knew on the tags
  
           You said ""see look it thats yours!
             Stacked on top with your brother's
               See how they resemble one another

     It fucks with your honor

          But you know that its good girl
          Cos its running you with red
  
  
 [Verse]
  
            Then the snow started falling
          We were stuck out in your car
           You were rubbing both of my hands
          Chewing on a candy bar
  
                       You said ""'aint this just like the present
        To be showing up like this""
            There's a moon waning crescent
     We started to kiss

 Please allow me to introduce myself
        I'm a man of wealth and taste
 I've been around for a long, long year
 Stole many a man's soul and faith
  
 And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
          Had his moment of doubt and pain
                      Made damn sure that Pilate
             Washed his hands and sealed his fate
  
 Pleased to meet you
                    Hope you guess my name
             But what's puzzling you
         Is the nature of my game
  
 I stuck around St. Petersburg
         When I saw it was a time for a change
                          Killed the Czar and his ministers
      Anastasia screamed in vain
  
    I rode a tank
         Held a general's rank
           When the Blitzkrieg raged
          And the bodies stank
  
 Pleased to meet you
                    Hope you guess my name
             But what's puzzling you
         Is the nature of my game
    I watched with glee
             While your kings and queens
             Fought for ten decades
          For the Gods they made
  
    I shouted out
                  ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
       When after all
         It was you and me
  
 Let me please introduce myself
        I'm a man of wealth and taste
                       And I laid traps for troubadours
          Who get killed before they reached Bombay
  
 Pleased to meet you
                    Hope you guess my name

 As heads is tails
               Just call me Lucifer

            Have some sympathy, and some taste
                               Use all your well-learned politesse

 [Intro]
 Billlllll - lyyyyyyyyy Shears
  
 [Verse 1]
 What would you think if I sang out of tune,
            Would you stand up and walk out on me.
 Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
            And I'll try not to sing out of key.
  
 [Chorus]
             Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends,
              Hmm, I get high with a little help from my friends,
             Hmm, gonna try with a little help from my friends.   (break)
  
 [Verse 2]
 What do I do when my love is away.
           (Does it worry you to be alone)
 How do I feel by the end of the day
           (Are you sad because you're on your own)
  
 [Chorus]
             No, I get by with a little help from my friends,
            Hmm, get high with a little help from my friends,

 [Bridge]
         Do you need anybody,
    I need somebody to love.
           Could it be anybody
    I want somebody to love.
  
 [Verse 3]
 Would you believe in a love at first sight,
            (Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.)
 What do you see when you turn out the light,
           (I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.)
  
 [Chorus]
             Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends,
            Hmm, get high with a little help from my friends,
                Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.
  
 [Bridge 2]
         Do you need anybody,
         I just need someone to love,
           Could it be anybody,
    I want somebody to love.
  
 [Chorus]
             Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends,
              Hmm, gonna try with a little help from my friends.
             Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends,

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
    Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me. 
    You have been so, so good to me. 
    Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me. 
    You have been so, so kind to me. 
  
 [Chorus]
         Oh the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
         Oh, it chases me down, fights 'till I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine. 
             I couldn't earn it. I don't deserve it. Still, You give yourself away. 
         Oh the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Verse 2]
    When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me. 
    You have been so, so good to me. 
    When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me. 
    You have been so, so kind to me.
  
 [Chorus]
         Oh the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
         Oh, it chases me down, fights 'till I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine.

         Oh the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
  
 [Bridge]
 (Play softly, then get louder each line)
 There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, coming after me. 
 There's no wall You won't kick down, no lie You won't tear down, coming after me. 
 There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, coming after me. 
 There's no wall You won't kick down, no lie You won't tear down, coming after me. 
 There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, coming after me. 
 There's no wall You won't kick down, no lie You won't tear down, coming after me. 
 There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, coming after me. 
 There's no wall You won't kick down, no lie You won't tear down, coming after me.

 Except that everyday she makes me feel like this.
     'Cuz she's exactly what I need.  (Oh Yeah, Oh Yeah.)
  
  
 [Chorus]
        She's soothing like, the ocean rushing over the sand.
            She takes care of me, and she helps me be a better man.
           She's so beautiful. Sometimes I stop to close my eyes. 
        She's exactly what I need.
        She's soothing like, the ocean rushing over the sand.

 [Verse]
   Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving but I know I saw a light in you
   as we walked we were talking and I didn't say half the things I wanted to
   of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
   I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
   Hey Stephen, boy you might have me believing I don't always have to be
       alone
  
  
 [Chorus]
   cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
   can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
   come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
        can't help it if there's no one else
   I can't help myself
  
  
 [Verse]
   Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
          so I've got some things to say to you
   I seen it all, so I thought, but I never seen nobody shine the way you do
   The way you walk, the way you talk, the way you say my name
   It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
   Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving
          I think you and I should stay the same

   can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so

 shine, shine, shine

   Well, all those other girls,
   well, they're beautiful but would they write a song for you

   I can't help it if you look like an angel

   I can't help myself.. if you look like an angel
   can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so

 [Verse 1]
    I’m tired of being what you want me to be
   Feeling so faithless
       Lost under the surface
    I don’t know what you’re expecting of me
      Put under the pressure
     of walking in your shoes
                                (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
         Every step that I take is
    another mistake to you
                                (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
  
  
 [Chorus]
 I’ve become so numb
                     I can’t feel you there
              Become so tired
                So much more aware
                 I’m becoming this
                 All I want to do
                   Is be more like me
                    And be less like you
  
  
 [Verse 2]
                            Can’t you see that you’re smothering me
   Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
                              Cause everything that you thought I would be
       Has fallen apart right in front of you
                                (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
         Every step that I take is
    another mistake to you
                                (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
             And every second I waste is more than I can take
  
  
 [Chorus]
 I’ve become so numb
                     I can’t feel you there
              Become so tired

                 I’m becoming this
                 All I want to do

                    And be less like you
  
  
 [Bridge]
          And I know I may end  up  failing, too
          But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you
  
  
 [Chorus]
 I’ve become so numb
                     I can’t feel you there

 Cut out all the ropes and let me fall

    I told you to be fine
    I told you to be balanced
  
    I told you to be kind
         In the morning I'll be with you
              But it will be a different ""kind""

 Two jumps in a week I bet you think thats pretty clever don't you boy?
 Flying on your motorcycle, watching the ground beneath you drop.
 You'd kill yourself for recognition, kill yourself to never ever stop
 You broke another mirror, you're turning into something you are not

 Drying up in conversation, you will be the one who cannot talk
 All your insides fall to pieces, you just sit there wishing you could still make love
 They're the ones who'll hate you when you think you've got the world all sussed out
 They're the ones who'll spit at you you will be the one screaming out

 [Verse 1]
   I don't know where I'm going,
   but I sure know where I've been.
   Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday.
    And I've made up my mind,
    I ain't wasting no more time,
             here I go again.
    Here I go again.
  
 [Verse 2]
   Though I keep searching for an answer,
   I never seem to find what I'm looking for.
   Oh Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on,
   'cause I know what it means,
     to walk along, the lonely street of dreams.
  
 [Chorus]
      And here I go again on my own,
        going down the only road I've ever known.
          Like a drifter I was born to walk alone.
   And I've made up my mind,
   I ain't wasting no more time.
  
 [Verse 3]
   I'm just another heart in need of rescue,
   waiting on love's sweet charity.
   And I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days,
   'cause I know what it means,
     to walk along, the lonely street of dreams.
  
 [Chorus]
      And here I go again on my own,
        going down the only road I've ever known.
          Like a drifter I was born to walk alone.
   And I've made up my mind,
   I ain't wasting no more time.
      But here I go again,   here I go again.
    Here I go again,    here I go.

 I'm pretty damn sure these are correct. It sounds just like this. If you don't have a
 capo there is another version on this website that also sounds pretty good that doesn't

 [Verse 1]
  
      An empty street
      An empty house
     A hole inside my heart
       I'm all alone
       The rooms are getting smaller
     I wonder how
     I wonder why
     I wonder where they are
       The days we had
       The songs we sang together (oh yeah)
  
       And all my love
       I'm holding on forever
   Reaching for a love that seems so far.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
        So I say a little prayer
               And hope my dreams will take me there

      To see you once again my love
       Overseas from coast to coast
               To find the place I love the most
             Where the fields are green
      To see you once again
      My love

     I go to work

     I wonder how
     I wonder why
     I wonder where they are
       The days we had
       The songs we sang together (oh yeah)

 [Verse]
  
     It’s late in the evening
     She’s wondering what clothes to wear
     She puts on her make up
     And brushes her long blonde hair
     And then she asks me
     Do I look alright?
                      And I say yes, you look wonderful tonight
  
 (Main Riff)
  
     We go a party
     And everyone turns to see
     This beautiful lady
     Is walking around with me
     And then she asks me
     Do you feel alright?
                    And I say yes, I feel wonderful tonight
  
  
     I feel wonderful
             Because I see the love light in your eyes
                  And the wonder of it all
                      Is that you just don’t realize
                     How much I love you
  
 (Main Riff)
  
     It’s time to go home now
     And I’ve got an aching head
     So I give her the car keys
     And she helps me to bed
     And then I tell her
     As I turn out the light
                    I say my darling, you were wonderful tonight
     Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight

0,Slide chords,Slide – Goo Goo Dolls,"Ok, enough is enough.I have seen tabs for this song that are partially right.
 Well I'd say 90-95% right. The only problem is that every tab on here has been
 tabbed for 1 guitar, when in the real of it, there are 2 guitars. So here is the
 proper tab with both guitars. Or you could just play 1 your choice! Sorry if it's
 confusing, just e-mail me and ask about it! ( jm300club@msn.com )
  
 Figure out the strum pattern on your own ! (sorry! to hard to tab that out, but

 [Chorus]
             I'm going back to 505 If it's a 7 hour flight
           Or a forty-five minute drive
     In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
             With your hands between your thighs
  
 [Verse 1]
 Stop and wait a sec when you look at me like that
             My darling what did you expect? I probably still adore you
            With your hands around my neck or I did last time I checked
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Verse 2]
      I'm not shy of a spark 
      The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
 Frightened by the bite no it's no harsher than the bark
     A middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start
  
 [Chorus]
             I'm going back to 505 If it's a 7 hour flight

 [Verse 3] (Faster strumming)
                    But I crumble completely when you cry
      It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
       I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
           Take my hands off of your eyes too soon
  
 [Chorus]
             I'm going back to 505 If it's a 7 hour flight

                                    Damn your love  Damn your lies
                      Break The silence

 [Chorus 2]
         And if you don't love me now
           You will never love me again
             And I can still hear you sayin'
            you will never break the chain (never break the chain).

 The guitar sort of fades in with a rhythm  You just play the High E string

    Masasayang mga araw na kasama kita
    Paglalambing at kulit mo na hindi nakakasawa
    Punong puno ng ligaya ang ating pagsasama
    Na parang wala nang sisira ng lahat -haaat

 [Verse 2]
    Paano na ang lahat paano na ako, tayo
    Hindi ba’t sinabi mo sa’kin na sabay tayong mangangarap
    Bakit bigla kang lumisan ng hindi man lang nagpaalam
  
 [Pre-chorus]
    Isang malamig na hangin ang yumakap sa akin
    Parang isang pahiwatig na magpapaalam ka na

 INTRO:
 NONE
  
 VERSE:
   She just wants to be 
                 Beautiful she goes 
                   Unnoticed, she knows 
      No limits she craves 
                   Attention, she praises 
  
 An image
        She prays to be 
                    Sculpted by the sculptor
  
  
 VERSE:
                 Oh, she don't see 
                    The light that's shining
                            Deeper than the eyes can find it
                          Maybe we have made her blind
           So she tries to cover up her pain 
                    And cut her woes away
                           'Cause covergirls don't cry 
  
 After their face is made
  
  
  
 CHORUS:

 VERSE:
                    She has dreams to be 
               An envy, so she's 
  
 Starving you know,
   covergirls eat nothing she says 
                                        ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
                           ""What's a little bit of hunger?""
  
 ""I could go a little while longer,""
   She fades away
 She don't see her perfect, 
            She don't understand she's worth it
           Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
     Oh Oh
     Oh oh
         So to all the girls that's hurting
         Let me be your mirror, 
                  Help you see a little bit clearer
  
 The light that shines within

        Just run into my arms

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse]
    There is a house built out of stone
    Wooden floors, walls and window sills...
    Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust...
    This is a place where I don't feel alone
    This is a place where I feel at home...
  
 [interlude]
  
 [Chorus]
       And, I built a home  for you    for me
     Until it disappeared from me    from you        
       And now, it's time to live and turn to dust........
  
 [Interlude]
  
 [Verse]
 Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
 There is a tree as old as me
 Branches were sewn by the color of green
 Ground had arose and passed it's knees
         By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
 I climbed the tree to see the world
           When the gusts came around to blow me down

 Song: Mr Brightside
 Tabber: James Simmons
 Comments: Quite an old song now but i play this acoustically and it sounds
 so good. I put a capo on fret 2 because it suits my voice but it can be played
 without.
  
 Chords:
               eadgbe
                                         
 it doesnt take a genius to work out this song is based around the shape and sound
 of Dsus2 as every chord is shaped around the (xx0230)
  
  
 [Intro/Verse 1]
  
 this is repeated throughout the intro as well as verse 1, the chords are tabbed

 [Verse 1]
  
              I'm coming out of my cage
                                           And I’ve been doing just fine
                                 Gotta gotta be down
  
         Because I want it all
              It started out with a kiss
                                         How did it end up like this
                                    It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
               Now I’m falling asleep
                                      And she’s calling a cab
                                      While he’s having a smoke
  
         And she’s taking a drag
               Now they’re going to bed
                                   And my stomach is sick
                                     And it’s all in my head
  
         But she’s touching his

                                        Now, he takes off her dress
                              Now, let me go
                 And I just can’t look its killing me
                      And taking control
  
  
 [Chorus 1]
  
                  Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
                  Swimming through sick lullabies
                  Choking on your alibis
                  But it’s just the price I pay
                  Destiny is calling me
                  Open up my eager eyes
                 ‘Cause I’m Mr Brightside

  I read the news today oh boy                   
  About a lucky man who made the grade
  And though the news was rather sad
  Well I just had to laugh
 I saw the photograph
  
 He blew his mind out in a car / He didn't notice that the lights had changed
 A crowd of people stood and stared / They'd seen his face before
 Em                                                 C....
 Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
  
 I saw a film today oh boy / The English Army had just won the war
 A crowd of people turned away / But I just had to look
 Having read the book....
  
  I'd love to turn.... you.... on....
  
 (stays on Em for awhile then goes to E-major)
  
 Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my head
           Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
      And looking up, I noticed I was late
           Found my coat and grabbed my hat, made the bus in seconds flat
           Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
      And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
  
  
    Ahhh....
    
  
 I heard the news today oh boy / Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
 And though the holes were rather small / They had to count them all
 Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
 I'd love to turn... you... on...

 [Verse]
  
 An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
 His hands were meant for different work and his heart was known to none 
 He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
         And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay
 A quiet man of music, denied a simpler fate
 He tried to be a soldier once but his music wouldn't wait
 He earned his love through discipline, a thund'ring velvet hand
       His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

 The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
          But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul

           When the night has come
 And the land is dark
          And the moon is the only light we'll see
       No I won't be afraid, oh I won't be afraid
          Just as long as you stand, stand by me
  
                       So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
     oh stand, stand by me, stand by me
  
         If the sky that we look upon
 Should tumble and fall
         Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
          I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
          Just as long as you stand, stand by me

 You made me insecure
 Told me I wasn't good enough
 But who are you to judge
 When you're a diamond in the rough
 I'm sure you got some things
 You'd like to change about yourself
 But when it comes to me
 I wouldn't want to be anybody else

 I'm just beautiful me

 It's such a funny thing
 How nothing's funny when it's you
 You tell 'em what you mean
 But they keep whiting out the truth
 It's like a work of art
 That never gets to see the light
 Keep you beneath the stars
 Won't let you touch the sky

              She said I love you till the day that I die
   Maybe she's right
                      Cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me

   I let myself get down in the first place

   Sunflowers still grows at night
   Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
          Make it down down, do-do-down
         Make it do-down, du du du
   Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

 You know you need to get yourself to sleep and dream
       And dream of you and I
             There's no need to keep an open eye
   I promise I'm the one for you
                      Just let me hold you in these arms tonight
 I'm lucky to be near you
         You can see it in my face
              Back when I fucked my shit up too many times
             Why would I let myself get down in the first place
  
  
 [Chorus 2] 2:23
 Trying to keep my mind at bay
   Sunflowers still grows at night
   Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
          Make it down down, do-do-down
         Make it do-down, du du du
   Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
  
  
 [Bridge] 2:53-3:21
 N.C.
 And so she sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry
 N.C.
 Said I didn't need to get down and feel empty inside
 N.C.
 And told me that she love me for as long as she's alive
 N.C.
 And well, maybe she's right, cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me
 N.C.
 See, I honestly, don't even know why
 N.C.
 I, I honestly don't even know why
  
  
 [Chorus] 3:40
   Trying to keep my mind at bay
   Sunflowers still grows at night
   Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
          Make it down down, do-do-down
         Make it do-down, du du du
   Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

 Artist: Rolling Stones
 Album: Sticky Fingers
 Tabbed By: Michael MacMillan
 Here's a great and easy strum-along song by the Stones. It's essentially
 three chords throughout the whole song and it has a country feel to it.
  
 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
 Well, when you're sittin' there, in your silk upholstered chair
 Talkin' to some rich folk that you know
 Well, I hope you won't see me, in my ragged company
 cause you know I could never be alone
  
 [Pre-chorus]
           Take me down little Suzie, take me down
    I know you think you're the queen of the underground
  
 [Chorus]
          You can send me dead flowers every morning
 Send me dead flowers by the mail
 Send me dead flowers at my wedding
        And I won't forget to put roses on your grave
  
 [Verse 2]
 Well, when you're sittin' back in your rose pink Cadillac
 Makin' bets on Kentucky Derby day
 Well, I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
      And another girl can take my pain away
  
 [Pre-chorus]
          Take me down little Suzie, take me down
    I know you think you're the queen of the underground
  
 [Chorus]
              And you can send me dead flowers every morning
 Send me dead flowers by the mail
 Send me dead flowers to my wedding
        And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

 [Verse 1]
 When I got the news today,
                              I didn't know what to say,
                               So I just hung up the phone.
 I took a walk to clear my head
 And this is where the walking lead.
                                   Can't believe you're really gone
 I don't feel like going home

 So I'm gonna sit right here,
 On the edge of this pier
 And watch the sunset disappear
 D (single strum)      G
 And drink a beer.
  
 [Verse 2]
 Funny how the good ones go,
 Too soon but the good lord knows
                         The reasons why I guess.
 Sometimes the greater plan
 Is kinda hard to understand
 Right now it don't make sense.
   I can't make it all make sense.
  
 [Chorus 2]
 So I'm gonna sit right here,
 On the edge of this pier
 And watch the sunset disappear
 And drink a beer
  
 [Bridge]
 So long my friend, until we meet again
             Well I'll remember you
  
               And all the times that we used to

 Sit right here,
 On the edge of this pier
 And watch the sunset disappear
 And drink a beer

 There is a swelling storm

         And it takes control of the person that I thought I was
                     The boy I used to know
 There is a light in the dark
 And I feel its warmth
        In my hands, in my heart
 Why can't I hold on?

 It always does, it always does
     We watch as our young hearts fade
 Into the flood, into the flood

 Slips through my fingers
 Trying hard to let go

 Moments of magic and wonder
 Seems so hard to find
 Is it coming back again?
 Is it ever coming back again?
 Take me back to the feeling when
 Everything was left to find

    Take me home, I'm fallin'
   Love me long, I'm rollin'
     Losing control, body and soul
    Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
    Walk you down, I'm all in
   Hold you tight, you call and
   I'll take control, body and soul
    Mind too for sure, I'm already yours
   Would that be alright?
   Hey, would that be alright?
                      I want you to the bone ooh..
                   So bad I can't breathe ooh..

 [Bridge]
      Of all the ones that begged to stay
         I'm still longing for you
      Of all the ones that cried their way
        I'm still waiting on you
    Maybe we seek for something that
        We couldn't ever have
    Maybe we choose the only love
       We know we won't accept
        Or maybe we're taking all the risks
        For something that is real
      'Cause maybe the greatest love of all
      Is who the eyes can't see, yeah

 [Verse 1]
  
 Forever could never be long enough for me
     To feel like Ive had long enough with you
 Forget the world now we wont let them see
         But theres one thing left to do
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 Now that the weight has lifted
 And love has surely shifted my way
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Marry me             today and every day
      Marry me, if I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe

 [Verse 2]
  
 Together could never be close enough for me
 To feel like I am close enough to you
 You wear white and Ill wear out the words I Love
 You and You're Beautiful

 Now that the wait is over
 And love has finally shown her my way

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
    I don't think that passenger seat
      Has ever looked this good to me
     He tells me about his night 
 I count the colors in his eyes
  
        He'll never fall in love he swears
        As he runs his fingers through his hair
      I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
      And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
     He tells a joke, I fake a smile
      But I know all his favorite songs
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 And I could tell you
                His favorite color's green
              He loves to argue
               Born on the seventeenth
                His sister's beautiful 
              He has his father's eyes
             And if you ask me if I    love him...
 I'd lie
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 He looks around the room
 Innocently overlooks the truth
 Shouldn't a light go on?
 Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long
  
 He sees everything in black and white
 Never let nobody see him cry
 I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
           I could tell you
                His favorite color's green
              He loves to argue
               Born on the seventeenth
                His sister's beautiful 
              He has his father's eyes
             And if you ask me if I    love him...
 I'd lie
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 He stands there, then walks away
     My God, if I could only say
      I'm holding every breath for you
  
              He'd never tell you
               But he can play guitar
                  I think he can see through
                 Everything but my heart 
                        First thought when I wake up is
                My God, he's beautiful
                  So I put on my make-up and pray for a   miracle
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
               Yes I could tell you
                His favorite color's green
              He loves to argue
              Oh, and it kills me
                His sister's beautiful
              He has his father's eyes
             And if you ask me if I love him...
         If you ask me if I     love him...
 I'd lie

 fight all the time

          The smell of your skin lingers   on me now 
          Your probably on your flight back to your home town 
       I need some shelter of my own protection baby 
              To be with myself and center,       clarity, peace, serenity.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 I hope you know, I hope you know 
 That this has nothing to do with you 
 It's personal, Myself and I 
                 We've got some straightenin' out to do 
                And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket.
                       But Ive got to get a move on with my life 
 Its time to be a big girl now and big girls don't cry.

 [Verse 2]
  
              The path that I'm walking I    must go alone
       I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full grown, full grown
       Fairytales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
          And I foresee the dark ahead    if I stay

 I hope you know, I hope you know 
 That this has nothing to do with you

 We'll play jacks and uno cards
 I'll be your best friend and you'll be mine, Valentine
 Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
 'Cause I want to hold yours too
 We'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds
 But it's time for me to go home
               It's getting late, dark outside
            I need to be with myself and center clarity, peace, serenity

 I heard your suitcase say goodbye

 You say true love, it's suicide

 And now you're swimming for the shore 
                             You left me drowning in my tears 
 And you won't save me anymore 
 I pray to God you'll give me one more chance, girl

 I'll be there for you 
  
 I'd live and I'd die for you
        Steal the sun from the sky for you 
    Words can't say what a love can do 
 I'll be there for you

                                    I know you know, we've had some good times.
 Now they have their own hiding place
                      I can't promise you tomorrow
 But I can't buy back yesterday
                                 And baby you know my hands are dirty (oh woman you know my hands are dirty)
                                But I wanted to be your valentine
                            I'll be the water when you get thirsty baby 
                               When you get drunk I'll be the wine
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 I'll be there for you

                             I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby

 [Verse]
  
   I've been here before
   But always hit the floor
       I've spent a lifetime running
        And I always get away
            But with you I'm feeling something
       That makes me want to stay
  
   I'm prepared for this
   I never shoot to miss
        But I feel like a storm is coming
         If I'm gonna make it through the day
               Then there's no more use in running
          This is something I gotta face
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   If  I   risk it all
   Could you  break my fall?
            How do I live? How do I breathe?
                   When you're not here I'm suffocating
                 I want to feel love, run through my blood
              Tell me is this where I give it all up?

            Know that I won't be afraid

 ~She's Always a Woman~
 by: Billy Joel
  
 [Intro]
  
  
 Pick the high E string and D string for eack chord.
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
        ~  She can kill with a smile
           She can wound with her eyes
           She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
           And she only reveals what she wants you to see
       She hides like a child
             But shes always a woman to me
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
           She can lead you to love
           She can take you or leave you
           She can ask for the truth
             But she'll never believe
            And shell take what you give her, as long as its free
        She steals like a thief
            But shes always a woman to me
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Ohhh..  she takes care of herself
                        She can wait if she wants
         Shes ahead of her time
  
 Ohhh.. and she never gives out
                      And she never gives in
              She just changes her mind
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
              And she'll promise you more
              Than the garden of eden
                 Then she'll carelessly cut you
         And laugh while you're bleedin'
              But she'll bring out the best
            And the worst you can be
            Blame it all on yourself
               Cause shes always a woman to me

 [Chorus]
  
 Ohhh..  she takes care of herself
                        She can wait if she wants
         Shes ahead of her time
  
 Ohhh.. and she never gives out
                      And she never gives in
              She just changes her mind
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
              She is frequently kind
              And she's suddenly cruel
                       She can do as she pleases
         Shes nobody's fool
          But she cant be convicted
        She's earned her degree
          And the most she will do
           Is throw shadows at you
           But shes always a woman to me

 Beauty queen of only eighteen
 She had some trouble with herself
 He was always there to help her
 She always belonged to someone else
  
 I drove for miles and miles
         And wound up at your door
 I've had you so many times but
 somehow I want more
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 I don't mind spending everyday
 Out on your corner in the pouring rain
 Look for the girl with the broken smile
 Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
           And she will be loved
           And she will be loved

 Tap on my window knock on my door
 I want to make you feel beautiful
 I know I tend to get so insecure
 It doesn't matter anymore
  
 It's not always rainbows and butterflies
       It's compromise that moves us along
 My heart is full and my door's always open
      You come anytime you want

                Alone in your car
                    Know all of the things that make you who you are
 I know that goodbye means nothing at all
 Comes back and begs me to catch
                    her every time she falls

 [Verse 1]
        I was born by the river, in a little tent,
         Oh and, just like that river, I've, been running, ever since.
              It's been a long... a long time coming, but I know, oh-oh-oh,
  A change is gonna come, oh, yes it will.
  
 [Verse 2]
            It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die,
  'Cos I don't know what's out there, beyond the sky.
              It's been a long... a long time coming, but I know, oh-oh-oh,
  A change is gonna come, oh, yes it will.
  
 [Verse 3]
    I go to the movie and I go downtown,
  Somebody keep telling me; don't, hang around.
              It's been a long... a long time coming, but I know, oh-oh-oh,
  A change is gonna come, oh, yes it will.

  Then I go to my brother,
  And I say; brother, help me please.
  But he winds up, knockin' me,
  Back down on my knees, oh...

  But now I think I'm able to, carry on.

 [Intro]
  
  Is this the real life?  Is this just fantasy?
  Caught in a land-slide; no es-cape from re-ali-ty.
  
  Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see.
  I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm;
  
  Easy come, easy go, little high, little low.
  Any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me... to me.

 [Verse 1]
  
  Mama, just killed a man,
        Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
  Mama, life had just begun,
      But now I've gone and thrown it all a-way.
  
  Mama, ooh-ooh, didn't mean to make you cry.
     If I'm not back again, this time to-morrow;
        Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters.
  
  
 [Interlude]
  
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
  Too late; my time has come,
       Sent shivers down my spine, body's achin' all the time.
  Goodbye everybody; I've got to go.
        Gotta leave you all be-hind and face the truth.
  
  Mama, ooh-ooh, I don't want to die.
    I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.

 Love the Way You Lie (featuring Rihanna)
 album: Recovery
 tabbed by ambient203
  
 Tuning: Standard
 Capo 3
  
 x = muted strings
  
  
 Most of the chord tabs for this song look good, but there's a few
 alterations in the chords throughout the song I thought I'd note here.
 I think the chorus is pretty much exactly the same as the verse, this is
 kinda how it should look:
  
 Em: Last few strokes should have pinky on G (high e string), right before
 the quick up-down between chord changes. It's not very noticeable, but it
 makes playing the song more interesting.
  
 C: For this, you should have the pinky on G a little earlier, on the first
 or second downstroke. This is more accentuated than the brief G in the Em
 bar.
  
 G: Pretty much just G, with the D on B string for the full sound.
  
 D: This is actually Dadd11 in the chorus and verse (not intro), G with an
 F# bass note (here it is, I didn't even know the name until I looked it up)
  
 2 x 0 0 3 3
  
 Make sure you get the nice down-strokes on the bass notes before playing
 full chords. And that's pretty much it. I try and avoid the high e string
 until the accentuated note is played (for instance, the C chord with high G)
  
 e|         3 D 3      3  3    |  - 3 is the G on pinky for the C chord
 G|       ^ ^ V ^ V    ^  ^ V  |  - D marks the upstroke where you should
 D|       ^ ^ V ^ V    ^  ^ V  |    stop playing at the end of a verse
 E| ^ *^  ^         ^          |  -  ^ = downstroke
                                  -  V = upstroke
  
 *(occasionally there's an upstroke here, after the chorus in C chord bar)
  
 I know that looks unnecessarily complicated, and you can probably figure
 it out yourself, but I thought I'd note it out since I've never done it before.
  
  
 Here's the piano bit that plays while Rihanna sings for the intro:
 The stars are devoiced notes that sound better played almost inaudibly.
 Make sure you have a capo on the 3rd fret!

                    (slide on D string)
 I love the way you lie
  
  
 [Verse]
  
                            I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
 And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
 I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
 As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
 High off of love, drunk from my hate,
                        it's like I'm huffin' paint and I love it, the more I suffer, I suffocate
 And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
 Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it, Wait!
 Where you going? I'm leaving you. No you ain't,
 Come back. We're running right back, here we go again, it's so insane
  
  
 Cuz when it's going good, it's going great
  
 I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
 But when and it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed,
 I snap ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
 I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
 I guess I don't know my own strength
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
             Just gonna stand there and watch me burn,
               But that's alright because I like the way it hurts.
             Just gonna stand there and hear me cry,
               But that's alright because I love the way you lie,
                     I love the way you lie
                     I love the way you lie
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
                    You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
      You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
           Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
             Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
                        You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
                             Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
      You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
            Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
           It's the face that's the culprit, it controls you both
                     So they say, you'd best to go your separate ways
                                      Guess that they don't know ya cuz today, that was yesterday,
                                Yesterday is over and it's a different day, 
                                                  Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her,
                                                 next time you'd show restraint, you don't get another chance
                                          Life is no nintendo game, but you lied again
  
  
 Now you get to watch her leave out the window
  
               Guess that's why they call it ""window pane""
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
             Just gonna stand there and watch me burn,
               But that's alright because I like the way it hurts.
             Just gonna stand there and hear me cry,

                     I love the way you lie
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
                Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
         And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
 But your temper's just as bad as mine is; you're the same as me
 When it comes to love you're just as blinded
      Baby please come back, it wasn't you. Baby it was me,
       Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
       Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
 All I know is I love you too much, to walk away though
 Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
 Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
 Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
 Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
 Next time? There won't be no next time
         I apologize, even though I know it's lies
                   I'm tired of the games, I just want her back. I know I'm a liar,
         If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again,
  
 Ima tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
  
 Just gonna
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 Stand there and watch me burn,

 Right from the start

      And I your willing victim
 I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
           And with every touch you fixed them

         If I'm wrong I am right, don't need to look no further
             This ain't lust, I know this is love... But
     If I tell the world, I'll never say enough

 [Verse 1]
  
    I met her in a club down in old Soho
            where you drink champagne and it tastes just like coca cola
           C-O-L-A, cola
      She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
    I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
           L-O-L-A, Lola,  Lo lo lo lo lola
  
 [Verse 2]
  
       Well I'm not the worlds most physical guy
               but when she squeezed me tight
             she nearly broke my spine, oh my Lola
              Lo lo lo lo Lola
  
 [Verse 3]
  
       Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
          why she walked like a woman and talked like a man
        oh my Lola
              Lo lo lo lo Lola   Lo lo lo lo Lola
  
 [Chorus 1]
  
          Well we drank champagne and danced all night
 under electric candlelight
      She picked me up and sat me on her knee
  
 and said 'Dear boy, won't you come home with me'
  
 [Verse 4]
  
       Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
             but when I looked in her eye, well I almost fell for my Lola
              Lo lo lo lo Lola Lo lo lo lo Lola
 Lola,  Lo lo lo lo Lola,  lo lo lo lo Lola
  
 [Bridge]
  
    I pushed her away
    I walked to the door
    I fell to the floor
        I got down on my knees
       Then I looked at her and she at me
  
 [Verse 5]
  
       Well that's the way that I want it to stay
        and I always want it to be that way for my Lola
              Lo lo lo lo Lola
 Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
         It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world except for Lola
              Lo lo lo lo Lola
  
 [Chorus 2]
  
         Well I left home just a week before
      And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
 Lola smiled and took me by the hand
  
 and said 'dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man'
  
 [Verse 6]
  
       Well I'm not the worlds most masculine man
        but I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
            and so is Lola, lo lo lo lo lola   Lo lo lo lo Lola

         All my bags are packed I'm ready to go.
      I'm standing here outside your door.
    I hate to wake you up to  say good bye.
          But the dawn is breaking it early morn.
      The taxi's waitin he's blownin his horn.
   Already I'm so lonesome I could die.

     So kiss me and smile for me.
   Tell me that you'll wait for me.
 Hold me like you'll never let me go.
            Cause I'm leavin on a jet plane.

             There's is many times I've let you down.
     So many time I've played around.
    I tell you now they don't mean a thing.
        Every place I go I'll think of you.
        Ev'ry song I sing I'll sing for you.
       When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring.
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 Now the time come to leave you.
 One more time let me kiss you.
       Then close your eyes I'll be on my way.
 Dream about the days to come.
       When I won't have to leave alone.
   About the times I won't have to say...

 [Verse]
       I'm lying alone with my head on the phone,
    thinking of you 'til it hurts
      I know you hurt too, but what else can we do,
      tormented and torn apart.
  
     I wish I could carry your smile in my heart,
       For times when my life seems so low.
            It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring,
          When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know.
  
 [Chorus]
      I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you,
     I know you were right, believing for so long.
      I'm all out of love, what am I without you,
     I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong.
  
 [Verse]
     I want you to come back and carry me home,
    Away from these long, lonely nights.
       I'm reaching for you. Are you feeling it too?
             Does the feeling seem oh, so right?
  
        And what would you say if I called on you now,
       And said that I can't hold on?
          There's no easy way, it gets harder each day,
          Please love me or I'll be gone.  I'll be gone.

 [Intro]
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
    Risin' up, back on the street,
   Did my time, took my chances.
   Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet,
          Just a man and his will to survive.
  
   So many times, it happens too fast,
   You change your passion for glory
   Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past,
            You must fight just to keep them alive:
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 It's the    eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight -
         Rising up to the challenge of our ri - val.
           And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night,
            And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger.
  
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 Face to face, out in the heat,
 Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry.
 They stack the odds, still we take to the street,
          For we kill with the skill to survive.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 It's the    eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight -
         Rising up to the challenge of our ri - val.
           And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night,
            And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger.
  
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
 Risin' up, straight to the top,
 Had the guts, got the glory.
 Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop,
          Just a man and his will to survive.
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 It's the    eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight -
         Rising up to the challenge of our ri - val.

            And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger.

  My love is pure
  I saw an angel

      She smiled at me on the subway

 [Verse 1]
   On bended knee is no way to be free
 Lifting up an empty cup, I ask silently
 All my destinations will accept the one that's me
 So I can breathe...
  
 [Verse 2]
 Circles they grow and they swallow people whole
 Half their lives they say goodnight to wives they'll never know
 A mind full of questions, and a teacher in my soul
 And so it goes...
  
 [Verse 3]
 Don't come closer or I'll have to go
 Holding me like gravity are places that pull
 If ever there was someone to keep me at home
 It would be you...
  
 [Verse 4]
 Everyone I come across, in cages they bought
 They think of me and my wandering, but I'm never what they thought
 I've got my indignation, but I'm pure in all my thoughts
 I'm alive...
  
 [Verse 5]
 Wind in my hair, I feel part of everywhere
 Underneath my being is a road that disappeared
 Late at night I hear the trees, they're singing with the dead
 Overhead...
  
 [Verse 6]
 Leave it to me as I find a way to be
 Consider me a satellite, forever orbiting
 I knew all the rules, but the rules did not know me
 Guaranteed
 Ooh ooh

 2007 Update:
 Since transcribing this song, I've seen it in Guitar World Magazine,
 GuitarOne Magazine, and Guitar Techniques Magazine - it looks as though
 my transcription is EXACTLY the same as in the Magazines (they ALL have
 the same chords as me, so I guess my transcription must be accurate :)

 Never made it as a wise man
 I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
 Tired of living like a blind man
 I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
 And this is how you remind me
 This is how you remind me of what I really am
 This is how you remind me of what I really am

 These five words in my head scream ""are we havin' fun yet?""
 Yeah,   yeah,   yeah,   no,   no
  
  
 [VERSE 2]
  
 It's not like you didn't know that
 I said I love you and I swear I still do
 And it must have been so bad
 Cause livin' with me must have damn near killed you
 And this is how you remind me of what I really am
 This is how you remind me of what I really am

                    And give her the best of me till the day that I die.
             I'm gonna marry your princess and make her my queen.
                      She'll be the most beautiful bride that I've ever seen.
                  I can't wait to smile,
                           When she walks down the aisle,
                     On the arm of her father,
          On the day that I marry your daughter.

 [Verse 1]
  
           Are you lonesome tonight, do you miss me tonight?
           Are you sorry we drifted apart?
             Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
           When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
          Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
         Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
          Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
          Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight.
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 (Talking verses, play the same chords)
  
 I wonder if   you are lonesome tonight
            You know someone said that the world's a stage
  
 And we each must play a part.
 Fate had me playing ""in love"" with you as my sweetheart.
                           Act one was where we met, I loved you at first glance
                You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
                    Then came act two, you seemed to change, you acted strange
  
 And why, I've never known.
    Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
            And I had no cause to doubt you.
    But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
 Than to go on living without you.
 Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
 With emptiness all around
                        And if you won't come back to me
 Then they can bring the curtain down.
  
          (sing again)
          Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
          Tell me dear are you lonesome tonight.

     My ship went down in a sea of sound
         When I woke up alone I had everything
    A handful of moments I wished I could change
        And a tongue like a nightmare that cut like a blade
       In a city of fools I was careful and cool
           But they tore me apart like a hurricane

    I wish I could change but I was carried away

 [Intro]
  
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 Took a deep breath in the mirror
 He didn't like it when I wore high heels
      But I do
 Turn the lock and put my headphones on
 He always said he didn't get this song
      But I do  
    -mute
 I do
  
    
 Walked in expecting you'd be late
 But you got here early and you stand and wave
    I walk to you
 You pull my chair out and help me in
 And you don't now how nice that is
      But I do
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
  And you throw your head back laughin' like a, little kid
 I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause,
 He never did
 And I've been spending the last eight months
 Thinkin' all love ever does is 
 Break, and burn, and end
 But on a Wednesday in a cafe
             -mute
 I watched it begin again
  
  
    
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 He said he never met one girl who
 Had as many James Taylor records as you
      But I do
 We tell stories and you don't know why
 I'm comin' off a little shy
      But I do
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
  But you throw your head back laughin' like a, little kid
 I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause,

 And I've been spending the last eight months
 Thinkin' all love ever does is 
 Break, and burn, and end
 But on a Wednesday in a cafe
 I watched it begin again
  
  
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
         And we walk down the block to my car
 And I almost brought him up
      But you start to talk about the movies 
                           That your family watches, every single Christmas
               And I want to talk about that

 And for the first time, what's past is past

       I’m leaving out today
  
 I just saw halley's comet she waved                  
 why are you always running in place
              even the man in the moon disappeared
       somewhere in this stratosphere
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
 tell my mother tell my father
                       I have done the best I can
 to make them realize
           this is my life
                   I hope they understand
 I am not angry I am just saying
    sometimes good bye is a second chance
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 please don't cry one tear for me
        I'm not afraid of what I have to say
 this is my one and only voice
 so listen close it's only for today
  
 I just saw halley's comet she waved                  
 why are you always running in place
              even the man in the moon disappeared

 [Verse]
           A hundred days have made me older, Since the last time that I saw your pretty face,
             A thousand lies have made me colder, And I don't think I can look at this the same
 An all the miles that separate,
 They Disappear now when I'm dreamin' of your face
  
 [Chorus]
 I'm here without you baby, But you're still on my lonely mind
                          I think about you baby and I dream about you all the  time
                             I'm here without you baby,  But you're still with me in my dreams,
         And tonight, there's  only you and me
  
 [Interlude]

 [Verse]
      The miles just keep rollin' As the people leave their way to say hello
                  I've heard this life is overrated But I hope that it gets better as we go,
        ohh yeah yeah*

 I'm here without you baby, But you're still on my lonely mind
                          I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time
                             I'm here without you baby,  But you're still with me in my dreams,
        And tonight girl, there's only you and  me
  
 [Bridge]
 Everything I know, and everywhere I go
                            It gets hard but it won't take away my love
 And when the last one falls, and when it's all said and done
                             It gets hard, but it won't take away my love, whoa oh

 Whack for the daddy ol',
          There's whiskey in the jar. 
  
 [Verse]
     I went into my chamber all for to take a slumber,
    I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder,
    But Jenny drew my charges and she filled them out with water,
          Then sent for Captain Farrel, to be ready for the slaughter.
  
 [Chorus]

 Whack for the daddy ol',

 [Verse]
     'Twas early in the morning just before I rose to travel,
    Up comes a band of footmen and likewise, Captain Farrel,
    I first produced my pistol for she stole away my rapier,
          But I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken.
  
 [Chorus]
        Musha ring dum a doo dum a da,
 Whack for the daddy ol',
 Whack for the daddy ol',
          There's whiskey in the jar. 
  
 [Verse]
     Now there's some take delight in the carriages a rolling
    and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
    but I take delight in the juice of the barley
          and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early
  
 [Chorus]
        Musha ring dum a doo dum a da,
 Whack for the daddy ol',
 Whack for the daddy ol',
          There's whiskey in the jar. 
  
 [Verse]
     If anyone can aid me 'tis my brother in the army,
    If I can find his station, in Cork or in Killarney,
    And if he'll go with me we'll go roving in Kilkenny,
          And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my old a-sporting Jenny.
  
 [Chorus]
        Musha ring dum a doo dum a da,
 Whack for the daddy ol',
 Whack for the daddy ol',

 I said,""Grandpa what's this picture here?
 It's all black and white and it ain't real clear
 Is that you there? He said yeah, I was 11.
 Times were tough back in '35
 That's me and Uncle Joe just tryin' to survive
 A cotton farm
 And a great depression

 Awe and this one here's taken overseas
 In the middle of Hell in 1943
 In the winter time, you can almost see my breath
 That was my tail gunner: Ole Johnny McGee

         And he had my back, right through the day we left

 All dressed up the day we said our vows.

           And just look at that smile I was so proud.

 [Verse 1]
      She came to me one morning, one lonely Sunday morning
      Her long hair flowing in the midwinter wind
    I know not how she found me for in darkness I was walking
         And destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win

 |    Ah...  ahahah...  ahahah

 [Verse 2]
      She asked me name my foe then, I said the need within some men
     To fight and kill their brothers without thought of love or God
        And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies
     So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life
  
 [Chorus]
 |    Ah...  ahah.. ahahah...  ahahah
 |    Ah...  ahahah...  ahahah
  
 [Verse 3]
          But she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals
     So easy to begin and yet impossible to end
      For she's the mother of our men who counselled me so wisely then
    I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay

      But when you need me be assured I won't be far away

       Thus having spoke she turned away and though I found no words to say
     I stood and watched until I saw her black coat disappear
     My labour is no easier but now I know I'm not alone
    I find new heart each time I think upon that windy day
      And if one day she comes to you drink deeply from her words so wise
       Take courage from her as your prize and say hello from me

 [Verse 1]
  
    Baby last night was hands down
                    One of the best nights
              That I've had no doubt
                Between the bottle of wine
            And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
            Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
          And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
             That all I need in this life is your crazy love
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
         If I never get to see the Northern lights
            Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
    Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
    Baby I could die a happy man yeah
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
    
  
 [Verse 2]
  
                      Baby and that red dress brings me to my knees
                      Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
             You're a Saint, you're a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
             It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
          In my wildest dreams
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
          And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
             That all I need in this life is your crazy love
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
         If I never get to see the Northern lights
            Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
    Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
    Baby I could die a happy man yeah
  
  
 [Instrumental]
  
    
  
 [Bridge]
  
            I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
    Baby you're my great escape
             We could stay at home, listen to the radio
       Or dance around the fireplace
  
  
 [Last Chorus]
  
             And if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
               Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
    Well if all I got is your hand in my hand
    Baby I could die a happy man
    Baby I could die a happy man
    Baby I could die a happy man
