Laid in the hot joints takin' the[/tab]\r\n[tab]                                 [ch]G[/ch]\r\npill. In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill.

They slapped my[/tab]\r\n\r\ndried up carcass in that county jail.\r\n\r\n[tab][ch]C[/ch]\r\n Early next mornin' 'bout a half past nine,[/tab]\r\n[tab]                         [ch]G[/ch]\r\nI spied a sheriff comin' down the line.

Just before the jury started out, I saw that little judge commence[/tab]\r\n[tab]               [ch]C[/ch]\r\nto look about.    In about five minutes in walked a man holding the verdict[/tab]\r\n[tab]   [ch]G[/ch]                                                       [ch]C[/ch]\r\nin his right hand. The verdict read in the first degree, I hollered lordy[/tab]\r\n[tab]                         [ch]C[/ch]\r\nlordy, have mercy on me.
