 Song: Waktu Yang Salah
  
 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
    Jangan tanyakan perasaanku
    Jika kau pun tak bisa beralih
    Dari masa lalu yang menghantuimu
      Karena sungguh ini tidak adil
  
 [Verse 2]
    Bukan maksudku menyakitimu
    Namun tak mudah untuk melupakan
      Cerita panjang yang pernah aku lalui
    Tolong yakinkan saja raguku
  
 [Chorus]
        Pergi saja engkau pergi dariku
         Biar kubunuh perasaan untukmu
        Meski berat melangkah
    Hatiku hanya tak siap terluka
       Beri kisah kita sedikit waktu
          Semesta mengirim dirimu untukku
       Kita adalah rasa yang tepat
                   Di waktu yang salah
  
 [Verse 3]
    Hidup memang sebuah pilihan
    Tapi hati bukan untuk dipilih
      Bila hanya setengah dirimu hadir
       Dan setengah lagi untuk dia
  
 [Chorus]
        Pergi saja engkau pergi dariku
         Biar kubunuh perasaan untukmu
        Meski berat melangkah
    Hatiku hanya tak siap terluka
       Beri kisah kita sedikit waktu
          Semesta mengirim dirimu untukku
       Kita adalah rasa yang tepat
                   Di waktu yang salah
  
 [Bridge]
    Bukan ini yang kumau
    Lalu untuk apa kau datang?
     Rindu tak bisa diatur
    Kita tak pernah mengerti
      Kau dan aku menyakitkan
  
 [Chorus]
        Pergi saja engkau pergi dariku
         Biar kubunuh perasaan untukmu
        Meski berat melangkah
    Hatiku hanya tak siap terluka
       Beri kisah kita sedikit waktu
          Semesta mengirim dirimu untukku
       Kita adalah rasa yang tepat
                   Di waktu yang salah

 [Verse 1]
         When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
 Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
      And in my hour of darkness, She is standing right in front of me
 Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
  
 [Chorus]
         Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
 Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
  
 [Verse 2]
      And when the broken hearted people, Living in the world agree
 There will be an answer, let it be
      But though they may be parted, There is still a chance that they will see
 There will be an answer, let it be
  
 [Chorus]
         Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
 There will be an answer, let it be

 Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

 [Verse]
    I heard there was a secret chord 
        That David played and it pleased the Lord 
       But you don't really care for music do you? 
           Well it goes like this 
       The fourth the fifth the minor fall and the major lift 
       The baffled king composing Hallelujah 
  
 [Chorus]
        Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah 
  
 [Verse]
   Well your faith was strong but you needed proof 
   You saw her bathing on the roof 
      Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you 
      She tied you to her kitchen chair 
      She broke your throne and she cut your hair 
      And from your lips she drew a Hallelujah 
  
 [Chorus]
       Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelu  -  jah 
  
 [Verse]
   Baby I've been here before 
       I've seen this room and I've walked this floor 
    I used to live alone before I knew you 
           And I've seen your flag on the marble arch 
      And love is not a victory march 
         It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah 
  
 [Chorus]
       Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah 
  
 [Verse]
 There was a time when you let me know 
         What's really going on below 
      But now you never show that to me do you? 
      But remember when I moved in you 
          And the holy dove was moving too 
      And every breath we drew was Hallelujah 
  
 [Chorus]
       Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah 
  
 [Verse]
 Maybe there's a God above 
      But all I've ever learned from love 
      Was how to shoot at somebody who outdrew you
      And it's not a cry that you hear at night 
       It's not somebody who's seen the light 
         It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

 This is meant to be a simpler way to play a highly complex song.  Not all the chords may sound 100%
 true to the record, but that was not my goal in this tab.  Some of the chords may look more difficult
 at first for beginners, but most of them are actually a lot easier to play than they look.  Authors, please
 refrain from complexifying any part of the song if you can help it.  I'm 100% open to changes but want to
 keep this simple.  There are far more accurate tabs if that is something you're looking for.  Thank you,
 and I hope you enjoy!
  
 [Intro]
  
 Is this the real life
 Is this just fantasy
 Caught in a landslide
      No escape from reality
 Open your eyes
       Look up to the skies and see
 I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
              Because I'm easy come, easy go,
 little high, little low,
 Any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me,
     To me
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Mama, just killed a man,
        Put a gun against his head,
            Pulled my trigger, now he's dead,
 Mama, life had just begun,
      But now I've gone and thrown it all  away
 Mama ooooh,
         Didn't mean to make you cry
     If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
        Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
  
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Too late, my time has come,
        Sends shivers down my spine
         Body's aching all the time,
 Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
        Gotta leave you all behind and face   the truth
 Mama ooooh (any way the wind blows)
 I don't want to die,
    I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

 I'm just a poor boy, no-body loves me.
 He's just a poor boy from a poor fami-ly.
 Spare him his life from this monstrosity.
 Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?  Bismillah!
 No, we will not let you go.  Bismillah!
 We will not let you go.  Bismillah!  We will not let you go.
 Will not let you go.  Will not let you go. Ahhhhhhhhh
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, mama mia, mama mia

 [Verse 1]
 Feeling my way through the darkness
 Guided by a beating heart 
 I can't tell where the journey will end 
 But I know where it starts 
 They tell me I'm too young to understand,
 They say I'm caught up in a dream 
 Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
 Well that's fine by me

 I tried carrying the weight of the world
 But I only have two hands
 Hope I get the chance to travel the world
 But I don't have any plans
 I wish that I could stay forever this young
 Not afraid to close my eyes
 Life's a game made for everyone
 And love is the prize

 [Verse 1]
 Come on skinny love, just last the year
 Pour a little salt, we were never here
          My my my - my my my - my my my my - my my ...
                 Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
 I tell my love to wreck it all
 Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
          My my my - my my my - my my my my my
               Right in the moment this order's tall
  
 [Chorus]
    I told you to be patient, I told you to be fine
    I told you to be balanced, I told you to be kind
           In the morning I'll be with you
              But it will be a different kind
            I'll be holding all the tickets
                 And you'll be owning all the fines
  
 [Verse 2]
 Come on skinny love, what happened here
 Suckle on the hope in lite brassiere
          My my my - my my my - my my my - my my ...
          Sullen load is full, so slow on the split
  
 [Chorus]
     I told you to be patient, I told you to be fine
     I told you to be balanced, I told you to be kind
       Now all your love is wasted, then who the hell was I?
                  Cause now I'm breaking at the britches
             And at the end of all your lines
  
 [Bridge]
 Who will love you? Who will fight?
 And who will fall, far behind?
 Come on skinny love ........

 [Verse 1]
  
 If you ever leave me baby
 Leave some morphine at my door
 Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
 To realize what we used to have, we don't,
  
 Have it anymore
  
 There's no religion that could save me
 No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh oh
 So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
 To keep you by my side to keep you from walking out the door
  
 [Chorus]
  
        Cause there'll be no sunlight
 If I lose you baby
 There'll be no clear skies 
 If I lose you baby
 Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same
     If you walk away

 I'll never be your Mother's favorite
 Your Daddy can't even look me in the eye, oooh
 If I was in their shoes I'd be doin' the same thing

                   Walkin' with that troublesome guy""
  
              But they're just afraid of something they can't understand, oooh
 But little by little watch me change their minds
                   And for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll tr---y
                     I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'
     If that'll make it right

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
 White lips, pale face,
                Breathing in snowflakes,
                Burnt lungs, sour taste.
 Light's gone, day's end
                 Struggling to pay rent,
                 Long nights, strange men.
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
        And they say she's in the Class A Team,
                Stuck in her daydream,
                       Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems
                    Slowly sinking, wasting
                  Crumbling like pastries
  
 And they scream
       The worst things in life come free to us,
  
  
 [Chorus]
            Cuz we're just under the upper hand
 And go mad for a couple grams
 And she don't want to go outside tonight
            And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
    Or sells love to another man,
 It's too cold outside
      For angels to fly
              Angels to fly
  
  
 [Verse 2]
 Ripped gloves, and raincoat,
                      Tried to swim and stay afloat,
              Dry house, wet clothes.
 Loose change, bank notes,
                Weary-eyed, dry throat,
              Call girl, no phone.
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
       And they say she's in the Class A Team,
                 Stuck in her daydream,
                      Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems
                   Slowly sinking, wasting,
                  Crumbling like pastries,
  
 And they scream,
       The worst things in life come free to us,
  
  
 [Chorus]
 Cuz we're just under the upper hand,
 And go mad for a couple grams,
 And she don't want to go outside tonight,
            And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland,
   Or sells love to another man,
 It's too cold outside,
      For angels to fly,
  
  
 [Bridge]
                  An angel will die.
                Covered in white,
  
 Closed eye,
       And hoping for a better life,
    This time, we'll fade out tonight
                     Straight down the line
  
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
        And they say she's in the Class A Team,
                  Stuck in her daydream,

                    Slowly sinking, wasting,
                  Crumbling like pastries
  
 And they scream,
       The worst things in life come free to us,
  
  
 [Final Chorus]
 Cuz we're all under the upper hand,
 And go mad for a couple grams,
 And we don't want to go outside tonight,
            And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland,
   Or sell love to another man
 It's too cold outside,
      For angels to fly
              Angels to fly
     To fly, fly
             Angels to fly, to fly, to fly
 Angels to die.

    Hello darkness, my old friend,
                             I've come to talk with you again,
                       Because a vision softly creeping,
                         Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
          And the vision that was planted in my brain
              Still remains
 Within the sound of silence.
  
 [Verse 2]
                               In restless dreams I walked alone
                          Narrow streets of cobblestone,
                     'neath the halo of a street lamp,
                            I turned my collar to the cold and damp
          When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
                      That split the night
   And touched the sound of silence.
  
 [Verse 3]
                           And in the naked light I saw
                             Ten thousand people, maybe more.
                     People talking without speaking,
                     People hearing without listening,
                 People writing songs that voices never share
                And no one dare
 Disturb the sound of silence.
  
 [Verse 4]
                           Fools said I, you do not know
                        Silence like a cancer grows.
                       Hear my words that I might teach you,
                      Take my arms that I might reach you.
         But my words like silent raindrops fell,
     And echoed
         In the wells of silence
  
 [Verse 5]
                           And the people bowed and prayed
                       To the neon God they made.
                           And the sign flashed out its warning,
                        In the words that it was forming.
                         And the sign said, the words of the prophets
                             Are written on the subway walls
               And tenement halls.
           And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.

   Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.
  
 [Chorus]
          Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong
          West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
  
 [Bridge]
  I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me.
      The radio reminds me of my home far away.
      And drivin' down the road I get a feelin' that I should have been home 
 yesterday, yesterday.
  
 [Chorus]
          Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong
          West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
  
 [Chorus]
          Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong
          West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
  
 [Outro]
          Take me home, (down) country roads.
          Take me home, (down) country roads.

      Oh, life is bigger
  
 It's bigger than you
              And you are not me.
                          The lengths that I will go to,
                       The distance in your eyes,
                       Oh no, I've said too much,
           I set it up.

            Trying to keep up with you.
        And I don't know if I can do it.

                     I'm choosing my confessions,

         Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool

           Consider this, consider this,
      The hint of a century,
           Consider this: the slip
       That brought me to my knees failed.
 What if all these fantasies
       Come    flailing around?
           Now I've said too much.

      I thought that I heard you laughing,

 My lover's got humour
                         She's the giggle at a funeral
                         Knows everybody's disapproval
                              I should've worshipped her sooner
                       If the Heavens ever did speak
                       She is the last true mouth piece

                  A fresh poison each week

 [Intro]
  
  
 [Verse 1]
  
 You got a fast car.
 I want a ticket to anywhere.
 Maybe we make a deal,
 Maybe together we can get somewhere.
 Any place is better.
 Starting from zero, got nothing to lose.
 Maybe we'll make something,
 Me myself, I got nothing to prove.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
 You got a fast car.
 I got a plan to get us out of here:
 I been working at the convenience store,
 Managed to save just a little bit of money.
 Won't have to drive too far
 Just 'cross the border and into the city, 
 You and I can both get jobs
      And finally see what it means to be living.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
 [Verse 3]
  
           You see, my old man's got a problem:
     He live with the bottle, that’s the way it is.
     He says his body's too old for working,
      His body's too young to look like his.
     My mama went off and left him, she wanted more from life than he could give,
           I said, ""Somebody's got to take care of him.""
     So I quit school and that's what I did.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
 [Verse 4]
  
 You got a fast car.
            But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
 We gotta make a decision:
 Leave tonight or live and die this way.

                              So I remember when: we were driving, driving in your car,
      The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,
 City lights lay out before us
           And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder. 
      And I   had a feeling that I belonged
      And I   had a feeling I could -- be someone, be someone, be someone.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
 [Verse 5]
  
 You got a fast car.
      And we go cruising to entertain ourselves;
 you still ain't got a job
        And I work in a market as a checkout girl.
 I know things will get better:
 You'll find work and I'll get promoted, 
 We'll move out of the shelter
 Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                               So I remember when: we were driving, driving in your car,
      The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,
 City lights lay out before us
           And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder. 
      And I   had a feeling that I belonged
      And I   had a feeling I could -- be someone, be someone, be someone.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
 [Verse 6]
  
 You got a fast car.
      And I got a job that pays all our bills.
 You stay out drinking late at the bar,
          You see more your friends than you do your kids.
 I'd always hoped for better,
 Thought maybe together you and me would find it,
 I got no plans I ain't going nowhere,
     so take your fast car and keep on driving.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
                              So I remember when: we were driving, driving in your car,
      The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,
 City lights lay out before us
           And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder. 
      And I   had a feeling that I belonged
      And I   had a feeling I could -- be someone, be someone, be someone.
  
 [Instrumental]
  
  
 [Verse 7]
  
 You got a fast car.
            But is it fast enough so you can fly away?
 You gotta make a decision:
 Leave tonight or live and die this way.

 [Verse 1]
 Never feared for anything
 Never shamed but never free
    A life to heal the broken heart
       With all that it could
  
 Lived the life so endlessly
 Saw beyond what others see
    I tried to heal your broken heart
       With all that I could

 Will you stay
 Will you stay away forever?

 [Verse 2]
 Plans of what our futures hold
 Foolish lies of growing old
      It seems we're so invincible
      The truth is so cold
  
 A final song, a last request
 A perfect chapter laid to rest
 Now and then I try to find
      The place in my mind
  
 [Bridge]
 Where you can stay
 You can stay awake forever

 Sleep tight
       I'm not afraid (not afraid)
      The ones that we love are here with me
 Lay away
    A place for me (place for me)

             I'll be on my way

 [Chorus 1]
 Once I was seven years old
                my momma told me
                                             go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
 once I was seven years old
  
 [Verse 1]
 It was a big big world
                                  but we thought we were bigger
  
 Pushing each other to the limits
           we were learning quicker
            By eleven smoking herb
                               and drinking burning liquor
                                         Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
  
 [Chorus 2]
 Once I was eleven years old
                my daddy told me
                                      go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
 Once I was eleven years old
  
 [Verse 2]
 I always have that dream
                           like my Daddy before me
  
 So I started writing songs
            I started writing stories
                       Something about that glory
                                just always seemed to bore me
  
 Cause only those I really love
            will ever really know me
  
 [Chorus 3]
 Once I was twenty years old
               my story got told
                                        before the morning sun, when life was lonely
 Once I was twenty years old
  
 [Verse 3]
   I only see my goals
                                I don't believe in failure
  
 Cause I know the smallest voices
           they can make it major
                I got my boys with me at least those in favor
  
 and if we don´t meet before I leave
           I hope I see you later
  
 [Chorus 4]
 Once I was twenty years old
               my story got told
  
 I was writing about everything
          I saw before me
 Once I was twenty years old
  
 [Chorus 5]
 Soon we´ll be 30 years old
                      our songs have been sold
  
 we've traveled around the world
                  and we´re still roaming
 Soon we´ll be 30 years old
  
 [Bridge]
 I´m still learning about life
                                  my woman brought children for me
  
 so I can sing them all my songs
            and I can tell them stories
   Most of my boys are with me
 some are still out seeking glory
  
 And some I had to leave behind
              my brother, I´m still sorry
  
 [Chorus 6]
 Soon I´ll be sixty years old
                     my daddy got sixty-one
                              remember life and then your life
  
 becomes a better one
   I made a man so happy
 when I wrote a letter once
 I hope my children come and visit
  
 once or twice a month
  
 [Chorus 7]
 Soon I´ll be sixty years old
                            will I think the world is cold
                          or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
 Soon I´ll be sixty years old
  
 [Chorus 7]
 Soon I´ll be sixty years old
                            will I think the world is cold
  
 or will I have a lot of children
          who can warm me
 Soon I´ll be sixty years old

 [Verse 2]
  
   Drew talks to me, I laugh cause it’s just so funny
   That I can’t even see, anyone when he’s with me
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus 2]
  
   He says he’s so in love, he’s finally got it right
   I wonder if he knows he’s all I think about at night
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   He’s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
   The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
   He’s the song in the car I keep singing, don’t know why I do
  
  
 [Verse 2]
  
   Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can’t breathe?
   And there he goes so perfectly
              The kind of flawless I wish I could be
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus 3]
  
   She’d better hold him tight, give him all her love
   Look in those beautiful eyes and know she’s lucky cause
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   He’s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
   The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
   He’s the song in the car I keep singing, don’t know why I do

 [Bridge]
  
   So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
   I put his picture down, and maybe get some sleep tonight
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
   Cause he’s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
   The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
  
   He’s the song in the car I keep singing, don’t know why I do
            He’s the time, taken up, but there’s never enough
           And he’s all that I need to fall into

          And I'm joining up the dots
             With the freckles on your cheeks
         And it all makes sense to me
      I know you've never loved
        The crinkles by your eyes
             When you smile,
 You've never loved
         Your stomach or your thighs
       The dimples in your back

 [Intro]
  
 [Verse 1]
 This is the first day of my life
 Swear I was born right in the doorway
 I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed
                  They're spreading blankets on the beach
  
 Yours is the first face that I saw
 Think I was blind before I met you
 Now I don't know where I am, I don't know where I've been
             But I know where I want to go
  
 [Chorus]
           And so I thought I'd let you know
       Yeah these things take forever
      I especially am slow
          But I realized that I need you and I wondered if I could come home
  
 [Instrumental]
  
 [Verse 2]
 Remember the time you drove all night
 Just to meet me in the morning
 And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
              You felt as if you'd just woke up
             And you said, ""This is the first day of my life.
 I'm glad I didn't die before I met you.
 But now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you,
          And I'd probably be happy.""
  
 [Chorus]
            So if you want to be with me
       With these things there's no telling
          We just have to wait and see
                    But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
  
 Than waiting to win the lottery
  
               Besides, maybe this time it's different,
                                  I mean I really think you like me

                 correctly- you HAVE to strum the A string with
                 each chord.
  
 **********************************************************************************
  
 NOTE- When transposed up 2x's to remove the capo, use D/F# for the Bm7 (Am7).
       A C/E sounds the same as a C so it didn't work for this CAPO ON 2 version.
       And I repeat-  THIS IS A CAPO ON 2 VERSION!!!

 [Verse]
  
  When your legs don't work 
            Like they used to before
  And I can't sweep you off of your feet
  Will your mouth still remember 
      The taste of my love
  Will your eyes still smile 
 From your cheeks                        
              And darling I will be loving you 'til we're seventy
             And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
 And I'm thinking 'bout how 
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 People fall in love in mysterious ways
 Maybe just the touch of a hand
       Well me I fall in love with you every single day 
      And I just wanna tell you I am
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
           So honey now
          Take me into your loving arms 
          Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
             Place your head on my beating heart 
               I'm thinking out loud
            And maybe we  found love right where we are
  
  
 [Verse]
  
  When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
  And the crowds don't remember my name
  When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
         I know you will still love me the same
                Cause honey your soul could never grow old it's evergreen
             And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
                I'm thinking 'bout how
  
  
 [Pre-Chorus]
  
 People fall in love in mysterious ways
      And maybe it's all part of a plan
       Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes 
 Hoping that you'll understand
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
            That baby now, oooooh
          Take me into your loving arms 
          Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
             Place your head on my beating heart 
               I'm thinking out loud
             That maybe we  found love right where we are, oh oh

   I'm tired of being what you want me to be
 Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
   Don't know what you're expecting of me
      Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
  
 (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
        Every step I take is another mistake to you

 Holding too tightly afraid to lose control

      Has fallen apart right in front of you

 Hint: starting with the C the bass tones should ascend till G/B and then go back down to C. The ascendance
 of the bass tones is crucial for the intensification of this part.

 So, if you want to play like her, then
 click the transpose down arrow 2 times (-2)
 and the chords become C G Am F. Make sure to put
 the capo on the 6th fret!
  
 *Note- Taylor plays the G as [320010]; A regular G
 works just fine though

 I was in your sights, you got me alone

 [Verse]
  
  Nice to meet you where you been
                            I can show you incredible things
  
 Magic, madness, heaven sin
  
 Saw you there and I thought
 Oh my God, look at that face
  
 You look like my next mistake
 Love’s a game, want to plaaaaay?
  
  New money, suit and tie
                            I can read you like a magazine
  
 Ain't it funny rumors fly
  
 And I know you heard about
 Me so hey, lets be friends
  
 I'm dying to see how this one ends
 Grab your passport and my hand
 I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
  So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames
  
 You can tell me when it's over mmm
                                If the high was worth the pain
  
 Got a long list of ex-lovers
                             They'll tell you I'm insane
                                                         Cause you know I love the players and you love the game
  
 Cause we're young and we're reckless
                             We'll take this way too far
  
  It'll leave you breathless, mmm
                      Or with a nasty scar
  
  Got a long list of ex-lovers
                             They'll tell you I'm insane  
                            But I got a blank space baby and I'll write your name
  
  
 [Verse]
  
 Cherry lips, crystal skies
                              I could show you incredible things
  
 Stolen kisses, pretty lies
                                You're the king baby I'm your queen
  
 Find out what you want
  
 Be that girl for a month
 Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
  
   Screaming crying perfect storms
                            I can make all the tables turn
  
 Rose garden filled with thorns
  
 Keep you second guessing
        Like ""Oh my God who is she?""
  
 I get drunk on jealousy
      But you'll come back each time you leave
                                 Cause darlin' I'm a nightmare, dressed like a daydream
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
  So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames
  
 You can tell me when it's over, mm
                                If the high was worth the pain
  
 Got a long list of ex-lovers

                            But I got a blank space baby and I'll write your name
  
  
 [Bridge]
  
  Boys only want love if it's torture
  
 Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn you
  Boys only want love if it's torture
  Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn you
  
  
 [Chorus]
  
  So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames

 Love Is A Burning Thing
